\begin{verse}
^{(D)}Out in the West Texas ^{Em}town of El Paso,
^{A7}I fell in love with a ^{.A7}Mexican ^{D}girl ^{D} \\
^{D}Nighttime would find me in ^{Em}Rosa's Cantina,
^{A7}music would play and ^{.A7}Felina would ^{D}whirl ^{D} \\
^{D}Blacker than night were the ^{Em}eyes of Felina,
^{A7}wicked and evil while ^{.A7}casting a ^{D}spell ^{D} \\
^{D}My love was deep for this ^{Em}Mexican maiden,
^{A7}I was in love, but in ^{.A7}vain I could ^{D}tell ^{D7}
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{G}One night a wild young ^{G}cowboy came in,
^{G}wild as the West Texas ^{D}wind ^{D7} ^{D7} ^{D7} \\
^{D7}Dashing and daring, a ^{D7}drink he was sharing,
with ^{D7}wicked Felina, the girl that I ^{G}love \\
So in ^{A7}anger...
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
I ^{D}challenged his right for the ^{Em}love of this maiden,
^{A7}down went his hand for the ^{.A7}gun that he ^{D}wore ^{D} \\
My ^{D}challenge was answered in ^{Em}less than a heartbeat,
the ^{A7}handsome young stranger lay ^{.A7}dead on the ^{D}floor ^{D}
^{D}Just for a moment I ^{Em}stood there in silence, 
^{A7}shocked by the foul evil ^{.A7}deed I had ^{D}done ^{D} \\
^{D}Many thoughts raced through my ^{Em}mind as I stood there,
^{A7}I had but one chance, and ^{.A7}that was to ^{D}run ^{D7}
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{G}Out through the back door of ^{G}Rosa's I ran,
^{G}out where the horses were ^{D}tied ^{D7} ^{D7} ^{D7} \\
^{D7}I caught a good one; it ^{D7}looked like it could run,
^{D7}up on its back and away I did ^{G}ride \\
Just as ^{A7}fast as I...
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
^{D}Could from the West Texas ^{Em}town of El Paso,
^{A7}out to the badlands of ^{.A7}New Mexi^{D}co ^{D} \\
^{D}Back in El Paso my ^{Em}life would be worthless;
^{A7}everything's gone in life ^{.A7}nothing is ^{D}left ^{D} \\
^{D}It's been so long since I've ^{Em}seen the young maiden,
^{A7}my love is stronger than ^{.A7}my fear of ^{D}death ^{D7}
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{G}I saddled up and a^{G}way I did go,
^{G}riding alone in the ^{D}dark ^{D7} ^{D7} ^{D7} \\
^{D7}Maybe tomorrow a ^{D7}bullet may find me,
to^{D7}night nothing's worse than this pain in my ^{G}heart \\
And as ^{A7}last here...
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
I ^{D}am on the hill over^{Em}looking El Paso,
^{A7}I can see Rosa's Cant^{.A7}ina be^{D}low ^{D} \\
^{D}My love is strong and it ^{Em}pushes me onward,
^{A7}down off the hill to ^{.A7}Felina I ^{D}go ^{D} \\
^{D}Off to my right I see ^{Em}five mounted cowboys,
^{A7}off to my left ride a ^{.A7}dozen and ^{D}more ^{D} \\
^{D}Shouting and shooting; I ^{Em}can't let them catch me,
^{A7}I have to make it to ^{.A7}Rosa's back ^{D}door ^{D7}
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{G}Something is dreadfully ^{G}wrong for I feel
a ^{G}deep burning pain in my ^{D}side ^{D7} ^{D7} ^{D7} \\
^{D7}Though I am trying to ^{D7}stay in the saddle,
I'm ^{D7}getting weary, unable to ^{G}ride \\
But my ^{A7}love for...
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
Fe^{D}lina is strong and I ^{Em}rise where I've fallen,
^{A7}though I am weary, I ^{.A7}can't stop to ^{D}rest ^{D} \\
I ^{D}see the white puff of ^{Em}smoke from the rifle,
^{A7}I feel the bullet go ^{.A7}deep in my ^{D}chest ^{D} \\
^{D}From out of nowhere, Fe^{Em}lina has found me,
^{A7}kissing my cheek as she ^{.A7}kneels by my ^{D}side ^{D} \\
^{D}Cradled by two loving ^{Em}arms that I'll die for,
^{A7}one little kiss and ^{.A7}Felina good^{D}bye 
\end{verse}
