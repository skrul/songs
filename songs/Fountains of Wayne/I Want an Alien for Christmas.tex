\begin{verse}
^{A}This year for Christmas there's ^{E}something I'd really like \\
So if you're ^{F#m}up there somewhere Santa, please don't ^{D}bring me another bike \\
I don't ^{A}need any ugly sweaters and I don't ^{E}play much basketball \\
But there's ^{F#m}something kind of special that ^{_B}I want most of ^{_B*}all
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus}
I want an ^{A}alien for Christmas \\
Bring me an ^{E}alien this year \\
I want a ^{G}little green guy, about three feet high \\
With ^{D}seventeen eyes, who knows how to fly \\
I want an ^{A}alien for ^{E}Christmas this ^{A}year ^{D} ^{A} ^{E}
\end{chorus} 
 
\begin{verse}
^{A}He can live in the bathtub so don't ^{E}worry about a thing \\
And I'll ^{F#m}take him out for walks when it gets ^{D}nicer in the spring \\
I'll ^{A}always keep him company, he'll ^{E}never be alone \\
You can ^{F#m}hang around the house all day and ^{_B}watch the twilight ^{_B*}zone
