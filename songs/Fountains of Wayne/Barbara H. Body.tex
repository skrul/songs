\begin{verse}
For a ^{D}small girl, Barbara sure has got a ^{D}big crush \\
The kind that makes you want to ^{G}break stuff, \\
And blame it on a man you don't ^{D}know \\
She ^{D}came down to New York City in a ^{D}big bus, nine hours driving \\
And you ^{G}can't just stay home, \\
So it doesn't matter which way you ^{F#m}go ^{-} ^{A}
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{(A)}And now ^{G}all ^{-} ^{D}day, the ^{A}radio's been playing the ^{G}sa ^{-} me ^{D}song \\
^{A}Can't shake that tune but it's ^{G}O - ^{D}K \\
^{A}Maybe the world isn't so ^{G}small \\
Barbara ^{Bb}knows it doesn't matter at ^{D}all
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
And ^{D}each day, Barbara wakes up in a ^{D}bad way, \\
Tells me quietly she has ^{G}absolutely nothing to say, \\
But I don't seem to ^{D}mind \\
And ^{D}she says she won't listen to the ^{D}band play, \\
She hates songs that never ^{G}seem to go away \\
Now neither will ^{F#m}mine ^{-} ^{A}
