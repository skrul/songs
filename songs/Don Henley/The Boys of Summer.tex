\begin{verse}
^{D#m} Nobody on the road,
^{D#m} nobody on the beach \\
^{B} I feel it in the air,
^{B} the summer's out of reach \\
^{C#}Empty lake, empty streets,
the ^{C#}sun goes down alone \\
^{B} I'm drivin' by your house,
^{B} though I know you're not at home
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{F#} But I can see you,
^{C#} your brown skin shinin' in the sun \\
^{C#} You got your hair combed back and your ^{B} sunglasses on, baby \\
^{F#} And I can tell you my ^{C#}love for you will still be strong \\
^{C#}After the boys of ^{B}summer have gone

\end{interlude}

\begin{verse}
^{D#m} I never will forget those nights,
^{D#m} wonder if it was a dream \\
^{B} Remember how you made me crazy,
^{B} remember how I made you scream \\
^{C#} Now I don't understand what ^{C#}happened to our love \\
^{B} But babe, I'm gonna get you back,
^{B} I'm gonna show you what I'm made of
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus}
^{F#} I can see you,
^{C#} your brown skin shinin' in the sun \\
^{C#} I see you walking really slow ^{B} smiling at everyone \\
^{F#} And I can tell you my ^{C#}love for you will still be strong \\
^{C#}After the boys of ^{B}summer have gone

\begin{verse}
^{D#m} Out on the road today, I saw a ^{D#m}Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac \\
^{B} A little voice inside my head said, ^{B}don't look back, you can never look back \\
^{C#} I thought I knew what love was,
^{C#} what did I know \\
^{B} Those days are gone forever,
^{B} I should just let them go but
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus}
^{F#} I can see you,
^{C#} your brown skin shinin' in the sun \\
^{C#} You got that top pulled down and that ^{B} radio on, baby \\
^{F#} And I can tell you my ^{C#}love for you will still be strong \\
^{C#}After the boys of ^{B}summer have gone
\end{chorus} 

\begin{chorus}
^{F#} I can see you,
^{C#} your brown skin shinin' in the sun \\
^{C#} You got that hair slicked back and those ^{B} Wayfarers on, baby \\
^{F#} And I can tell you my ^{C#}love for you will still be strong \\
^{C#}After the boys of ^{B}summer have gone
