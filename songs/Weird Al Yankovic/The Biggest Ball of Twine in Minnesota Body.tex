Of course, we stopped for more pickled ^{Bb}wieners now and then \\
The ^{Eb}scenery was just so pretty, ^{Ab}boy I wish the kids could've seen it \\
But you ^{Eb}can't see out of the side of the car, because the ^{Bb}windows are completely covered \\
With the ^{Eb}decals from all the places where ^{Bb}we've al^{-}ready ^{Eb}been \\

^{Eb}Finally, at 7:37 early ^{Ab}Wednesday evening, as the sun was setting in the ^{Eb}Minnesota sky ^{Db} ^{-}  ^{Ab}   \\
^{Eb}Out in the distance on the horizon, it ap^{Ab}peared to me like a vision before my ^{Eb}unbelieving eyes ^{Eb} \\
I ^{Eb}parked the car and walked with awe-filled ^*{Db}reverenc ^{-}e, towa^{Ab}rd that glorious, ^{Eb}huge, majestic sphere ^{Eb} \\

Yes, ^{Ab}on these hallowed grounds, open ^{Db}ten to ^{-}eight on ^{Ab}weekdays, in a ^{Eb}little shrine under a makeshift pa^{Eb}goda \\

Well, we ^{Eb}walked up beside it and I warned the kids \\
"Now, you ^{Ab}better not touch it, those ropes are there for a ^{Eb}reason" \\
I said "^{Eb}Maybe if you're good I'll tie it to the back of our ^{Ab}car and we can take it home" but I was only ^{Eb}teasin' \\
Then we ^{Eb}went to the gift shop and stood in line, bought a ^{Db}souvenir ^{-}miniature ^{Ab}ball of twine \\
Some ^{Eb}window decals and anything else they'd ^{Ab}sell us \\
And I ^{Eb}bought a couple postcards: "Greetings from the twine ball, ^{Bb}wish you were here" \\
Won't the folks back home be ^{Eb}jealous? \\
I gave our ^{Ab}camera to Bern^{-}ie and we ^{Eb}stood by the ball, and we ^{Bb}all gathered 'roun^{-}d and said, "^{Eb}Cheese" \\
Then ^{Ab}Bernie ran aw^{-}ay with my ^{Eb}brand new Instamatic, but at ^{F}least we ^{-}got our mem-or-^{Bb}ies
