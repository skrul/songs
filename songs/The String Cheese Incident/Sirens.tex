\begin{verse}
Sirens are callin' for someone, they're on the way \\
Which house is it gonna be? \\
Wailin' and cryin' comes closer still \\
It's on our street today \\
Roll of the dice, fate comes a-knockin' \\
Takes one more away \\
For all of their careful plannin' \\
Never thought it could end this way \\
I just want to say I love you \\
And make sure you feel it every day \\
'Cause if today had been my last chance \\
It's just something I wanted to say \\
Today is not my time to go \\
Grace has brought us another day \\
But if tomorrow were to bring my time \\
What would I leave unsaid? \\
What would I leave undone? \\
What would I leave behind? \\
I just want to say I love you \\
And make sure you feel it every day \\
'Cause if today had been my last chance \\
It's just something I wanted to say \\
I just want to say I love you \\
And make sure you feel it every day \\
'Cause if today had been my last chance \\
It's just something I wanted to say \\
I just want to say I love you \\
And make sure you feel it every day \\
'Cause if today had been my last chance \\
It's just something I wanted to say
