5 $\downarrow$ \\
1 $\downarrow$ $\swarrow$ $\downarrow$
\end{intro}

\begin{verse}
Sirens are callin' for someone, they're on the way \\
Which house is it gonna be? \\
Wailin' and cryin' comes closer still \\
It's on our street \chord{1 $\downarrow$ $\swarrow$ $\downarrow$}today \\
Roll of the dice, fate comes a-knockin' \\
Takes one more away \\
For all of their careful plannin' \\
Never thought it could end this way \\
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
I just want to say I love you \\
And make sure you feel it every day \chord{5 $\swarrow$ 5 $\uparrow$ 4 $\uparrow$} \\
'Cause if today \chord{7 $\uparrow$} had been my last chance \chord{5 $\swarrow$ 5 $\uparrow$ 4 $\uparrow$} \\
It's just something  \chord{7 $\uparrow$} I wanted to say \\
\end{chorus}

\begin{interlude}
4 $\swarrow$ $\downarrow$ $\swarrow$ $\downarrow$ $\swarrow$ $\downarrow$ \\
\end{interlude}

\begin{verse}
Today is not my time to go \\
Grace has brought us another day \\
But if tomorrow were to bring my time \\
What would I leave unsaid? \chord{4 $\swarrow$} \\
What would I leave undone? \\
What would I leave behind? \chord{1 $\swarrow$}  \\
\end{verse}
