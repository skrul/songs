\begin{verse}
^{D#7}Now I'm comin' over / see me down at the
^{G#7}station by the lane with my hands in my pocket \\
^{D#7}Jinglin' a wish coin / that I stole from a
^{G#7}fountain that was drownin' all the cares in the world though \\
^{D#7}When I gettin older / climbin' up on the
^{G#7}back porch fence, just to see the dogs runnin'  \\
^{D#7}Ring and a question / and my shiverin'
^{G#7}voice is singin' through a crack in the window
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
Na, na, na, na, na, ^{D#7}na / I better go it a^{G#7}lone \hspace{30pt}
Na, na, na, na, na, ^{D#7}na / I better go it a^{G#7}lone \\ \\
Na, na, na, na, na...
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
^{D#7}Down on the corner / see me standin' on a
^{G#7}makeshift home with a dust storm comin' \\
^{D#7}In a long black shadow / pull the hammer from a
^{G#7}coal mine down where your daddy was workin' \\
^{D#7}Comb my hair back / strike a match on the
^{G#7}bathroom wall where my number is written \\
^{D#7}Drivin' on a sidewalk / lookin' back at the
^{G#7}sky, it's burnin' in the rear view mirror
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
Na, na, na, na, na, ^{D#7}na / I better go it a^{G#7}lone \hspace{30pt}
Na, na, na, na, na, ^{D#7}na / I better go it a^{G#7}loo-woah-oh\\ \\
Na, na, na, na, na, ^{D#7}na \hspace{20pt} ^{D#7} \\
Na, na, na, na, na, ^{D#7}na \hspace{20pt} ^{D#7} Na, na, na, na, na, na

^{D#7}I'm comin' over / see you down at the
^{G#7}station by the lane with my hands in my pocket \\
^{D#7}Jinglin' a wish coin / that I stole from a
^{G#7}fountain that was drownin' all the cares in the world though \\
^{D#7}When I gettin' older / climbin' up on the 
^{G#7}back fence, pointing to the dogs standin' firm \\
^{D#7}With a ring and a question / dime a dozen and a
^{G#7}voice that was singin' underneath the window
\end{verse}
