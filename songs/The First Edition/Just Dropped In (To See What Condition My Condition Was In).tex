\begin{verse}
I ^{Dm}woke up this morning with the ^{G}sundown   shining ^{Dm}in \\
I ^{Dm}found my mind in a ^{Dm}brown paper bag   wi^{A7}thin \\
I ^{Dm}tripped on a cloud and fell-a ^{F}eight miles high, I ^{G7}tore my mind  on a jagged sky \\
I ^{Dm}just dropped in   to ^{A7}see what condition my con^{Dm}dition was in
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
I ^{Ebm}pushed my soul  in a ^{Ab}deep dark hole and then I ^{Ebm}followed it in \\
I ^{Ebm}watched myself crawlin' ^{Ebm}out as I was ^{Bb7}crawlin' in \\
I got ^{Ebm}up so tight, I ^{Gb}couldn't unwind, I ^{Ab7}saw so much, I broke my mind \\
I ^{Ebm}just dropped in   to ^{Bb7}see what condition my cond^{Ebm}ition was in

\begin{verse}
Some^{Em}one painted "April ^{A}Fool" in big black letters on a ^{Em}dead-end sign \\
I've had my ^{Em}foot on the gas since I ^{Em}left the road and blew ^{B7}out my mind \\
Eight ^{Em}miles out of Memphis and I ^{G}got no spare, eight ^{A7}miles straight up downtown somewhere \\
I ^{Em}just dropped in to ^{B7}see what condition my con^{Em}dition was in \\
I said, I ^{Em}just dropped in to ^{B7}see what condition my con^{Em}dition was in
