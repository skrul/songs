^{Dm}Yeah   yeah   oh, yeah, what condition my con^{Dm}dition was in
\end{chorus} 

\begin{verse}
I ^{(Dm)}woke up this morning with the ^{G}sundown   shining ^{Dm}in \\
I ^{Dm}found my mind in a brown paper bag   wi^{A7}thin \\
I ^{Dm}tripped on a cloud and fell-a ^{F}eight miles high, I ^{G}tore my mind  on a jagged sky \\
I ^{Dm}just dropped in   to ^{A7}see what condition my con^{Dm}dition was in
\end{verse}

\instruction{Repeat Chorus}
\end{chorus} 

\begin{verse}
I ^{Ebm}pushed my soul  in a ^{Ab/Eb}deep dark hole and then I ^{Ebm}followed it in \\
I watched myself crawlin' out as I was ^{Bbm7}crawlin' in \\
I ^{Ebm}got up so tight, I ^{Gb}couldn't unwind \\
I ^{Cmaj7?}saw so much, I broke my mind \\
I ^{Ebm}just dropped in   to ^{Bbm7}see what condition my con^{Ebm}dition was in
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
[Verse 3]
(Key change to Em)
Some^{Em}one painted "April ^{A/E}Fool" in big black letters on a ^{Em}dead-end sign \\
I've had my foot on the gas since I left the road and blew out ^{Bm7}my mind \\
Eight ^{Em}miles out of Memphis and I ^{G}got no spare \\
Eight miles ^{Cmaj7}straight up downtown somewhere \\
I ^{Em}just dropped in   to ^{Bm7}see what condition my cond^{Em}ition was in \\
I said, I ^{Em}just dropped in to ^{Bm7}see what condition my cond^{Em}ition was in
