\begin{verse}
You said you was ^{A7}hurtin',
almost lost your ^{A7}mind; \\
'Cause the man you ^{D7}love,
hurts you all the ^{D7}time. \\
But when things go ^{A7}wrong,
wrong with ^{E7}you, ^{D7} \\
It hurts me ^{A7}too. ^{D7} ^{A7} ^{E7}
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
You love him a little ^{A7}more,
when you ought to love him ^{A7}less. \\
Why pick up behind ^{D7}him
and take his ^{D7}best? \\
'Cause when things go ^{A7}wrong,
wrong with ^{E7}you, ^{D7} \\
It hurts me ^{A7}too. ^{D7} ^{A7} ^{E7}
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
You love another ^{A7}man;
oh, but I love ^{A7}you \\
But you love him ^{D7}darlin',
stick to him just about like ^{D7}glue. \\
But when things go ^{A7}wrong,
wrong with ^{E7}you, ^{D7} \\
It hurts me ^{A7}too. ^{D7} ^{A7} ^{E7}
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Well, he better leave ^{A7}you,
or you best put him ^{A7}down. \\
Cause you know, I just can't ^{D7}stand
to see, see you'all pushed ^{D7}around \\
â€˜Cause when things go ^{A7}wrong,
wrong with ^{E7}you, ^{D7} \\
It hurts me ^{A7}too. ^{D7} ^{A7} ^{E7}
