\begin{verse}
The first thing ^{D}I remember ^{G}knowin'
was a ^{D}lonesome whistle a-^{G}blowin' \\
And the ^{D}youngins dream of ^{G}growin' up to ^{A7}ride ^{A7} \\
On a ^{D}freight train leavin' ^{G}town,
not ^{D}knowin' where I's ^{G}bound \\
^{D}No-one could change my ^{A7}mind, but Mama ^{D}tried ^{D}
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
When an ^{D}only rebel ^{G}child,
from a ^{D}family meek and ^{G}mild \\
^{D}Mama seemed to ^{G}know what lay in ^{A7}store ^{A7} \\
Despite ^{D}all my Sunday ^{G}learnin',
toward the ^{D}bad, I kept on ^{G}turnin' \\
'Til ^{D}Mama couldn't ^{A7}hold me any ^{D}more ^{D*}
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
And I turned ^{D}twenty-one in ^{D}prison,
doin' ^{C}life without parole  ^{D}  \\
No-^{Bm}one could steer me ^{Bm}right, but Mama ^{A}tried, Mama ^{A}tried \\
Mama ^{D}tried to raise me ^{D}better,
but her ^{G}pleading I den^{D}ied \\
And that leaves ^{D}only me to ^{A7}blame, cause Mama ^{D}tried. ^{D}
\end{chorus}

\begin{interlude}

\end{tabular}
\end{interlude}

\begin{verse}
Dear old ^{D}daddy, rest his ^{G}soul,
left my ^{D}mom a heavy ^{G}load, \\
She ^{D}tried so very ^{G}hard to fill his ^{A7}shoes ^{A7} \\
Workin' ^{D}hours without ^{G}rest,
she wanted ^{D}me to have the ^{G}best. \\
She ^{D}tried to raise me ^{A7}right, but I ^{D}refused. ^{D*}
