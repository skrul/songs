"Baby, ^{Am}I don't feel so ^{D7}good", 6 words you ^{G}never under^{Em}stood  \\
"I'll never ^{Am}let you go", 5 ^{D7}words you'll never ^{G}say    ^{Em}   \\
I laugh a^{Am}long like nothing's ^{D7}wrong, 4 days has ^{G}never felt so ^{Em}long    \\

\begin{verse}
Is there a ^{Am}reason we're not ^{D7}through, 
Is there a ^{G}12 step just for you ^{Em}   \\
Our conver^{Am}sation's all in ^{D7}blue,
11 ^{G}heys,  ^{Em}   \\

\end{verse} 

\begin{chorus}
^{Am}How'm I s'posed to ^{D7}make you feel o^{G}kay    ^{Em}   \\
When ^{Am}all you do is ^{D7}walk the other ^{G}way       ^{Em}   \\
^{Am}I can't tell you ^{D7}how much I wish I didn't ^{G}wanna stay     ^{Em}   \\
^{Am}I just kinda ^{D7}wish you were gay ^{G}          ^{G*}
\end{chorus} 

\begin{bridge}
To spare my ^{Am}pride ^{D7}   \\
To give your lack of ^{G}interest an expla^{Em} nation   \\
Don't say I'm not your ^{Am}type  ^{D7}   \\
Just say I'm not your p^{G}referred sexual ^{Em}orientation \\
I'm so ^{Am*}sel-fish ^{D7} but you make me ^{G}feel helpless, yeah ^{Em} \\
And I can't ^{Am}stand another day ^{Am} \\
I can't s^{D7}tand another d^{D7}ay
