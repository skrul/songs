There are ^{A}places ^{E}I'll re^{F#m}member ^{A7/G} \\
All my ^ {D}li - ^{Dm}fe though ^{A}some have changed \\
Some for^{A}ever ^{E}not for ^{F#m}better ^{A7/G} \\
Some have ^*{D}go ^{Dm}ne and ^{A}some remain
\end{verse} 
 
\begin{bridge}
All these ^{F#m}places have their ^{D}moments,
with ^{G}lovers and friends I ^{A}still can recall \\
Some are ^{F#m}dead and some are ^{B}living,
in ^{Dm}my life I've ^{A}loved them all

\begin{verse}
But of ^{A}all these ^{E}friends and ^{F#m}lovers ^{A7/G} \\
There is ^{D}no ^{Dm}one com^{A}pares with you \\
And these ^{A}memories ^{E}lose their ^{F#m}meaning ^{A7/G} \\
When I ^{D}think of ^{Dm}love as ^{A}something new
\end{verse} 

\begin{bridge}
Though I ^{F#m}know I'll never lose af^{D}fection, for ^{G}people and things that ^{A}went before \\
I ^{F#m}know I'll often stop and think a^{B}bout them, in ^{Dm}my life I ^{A}love you more
