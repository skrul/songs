\begin{verse}
^{G} A dreaded sunny day, so I meet you at the cemetery ^{C}gates \\
^{C}Keats ^{-}and ^{D}Yeats are on ^{Em}your s^{-}ide ^{D} ^{/} ^{C} \\
^{G} A dreaded sunny day, so I meet you at the cemetery ^{C}gates \\
^{C}Keats ^{-}and ^{D}Yeats are on ^{Em}your s^{-}ide ^{D} ^{/} ^{C} \\
While ^{C} ^{-} ^{D}Wilde is on ^{G}mine
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
^{G} So we go inside and we gravely read the ^{C}stones \\
^{C}All those people all those ^{D}lives, Where are they ^{Em}now? ^{D} ^{/} ^{C} \\
With ^{G}loves, with hates, and passions just like ^{C}mine \\
They were ^{C}born, and then they ^{D}lived, and then they ^{Em}died ^{D} ^{/} ^{C} \\
Which ^{C}seems so unfair ^{D}and I want to ^{G}cry
\end{verse} 

\begin{chorus}
You say: "ere ^{Bm}thrice the sun hath door salutation to the ^{G}dawn" \\
And you ^{Bm}claim these words as your ^{G}own \\
But ^{C}I'm well read, have ^{D}heard them said \\
A hundred ^{Em}times (maybe less, maybe ^{F}more)
\end{chorus} 
 
\begin{verse}
If you ^{G}must write prose and poems the words you use should be your ^{C}own \\
Don't plagiarize or ^{D}take "on ^{Em}loan" ^{D} ^{/} ^{C} \\
There's always ^{G}someone, somewhere, with a big nose, who ^{C}knows \\
And who trips you up and ^{D}laughs when you ^{Em}fall ^{D} ^{/} ^{C} \\
Who'll ^{C}trip you up and ^{D}laugh when you ^{G}fall
\end{verse} 
 
\begin{chorus}
You say: "ere ^{Bm}long done do does ^{G}did"
^{Bm}Words which could only be your ^{G}own
You ^{C}then produce the text
From ^{D}whence was ripped
(some dizzy ^{Em}whore, ^{F}1804)
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
A dreaded ^{G}sunny day, so let's go where we're happy, and I meet you at the cemetery ^{C}gates \\
^{C}Keats ^{-}and ^{D}Yeats are on ^{Em}your s^{-}ide ^{D} ^{/} ^{C} \\
A dreaded ^{G}sunny day, so let's go where we're wanted and I meet you at the cemetery ^{C} gates \\
^{C}Keats ^{-}and ^{D}Yeats are on ^{Em}your s^{-}ide ^{D} ^{/} but you lose ^{C} \\
While ^{C} ^{-} ^{D}Wilde is on ^{G}mine
\end{verse}
