\begin{verse}
^{F}Come out Virginia, ^{G}don't let ^{-} me ^{Am}wait,
you ^{F}Catholic girls start ^{G}much ^{-}too ^{C}late \\
But ^{F}sooner or later it ^{G}comes ^{-}down to ^{Am}fate,
I ^{F}might as well be the ^{G}one
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Well, they ^{F}showed you a statue, ^{G}told you to ^{Am}pray,
they ^{F}built you a temple and ^{G}locked you ^{C}away \\
But ^{F}they never told you the ^{G}price that you ^{Am}pay,
for ^{F}things that you might have ^{G}done
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
Only the good die ^{C}young,
^{F} Thatâ€™s What I said ^{G} ^{C} \\
Only the good die ^{F}young,
only the good ^{G}die young ^{C}
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
You might have _{F} heard I run with a _{G} dangerous _{Am} crowd, \\
We _{F} ain't too pretty we _{G} ain't too _{Am} proud \\
We _{F} might be laughing a _{G} bit too _{Am} loud, \\
but _{F} that never hurt no _{G} one
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
So come _{F} on Virginia _{G} show me a _{Am} sign \\
_{F} Send up a signal I'll _{G} throw you the _{C} line \\
The _{F} stained-glass curtain you're _{G} hiding _{Am} behind \\
_{F} Never lets in the _{G} sun
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
Darlin' only the good die _{C} young,
_{F} whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa _{G} _{C} \\
I tell ya only the good die _{F} young,
only the good _{G} die young _{C}
\end{chorus}

\begin{bridge}
^{G}You got a nice white dress and a ^{F}party on your confir^{C}mation \\
You got a ^{D}brand new soul, And a ^{F}cross of gold \\
But ^{G}Virginia they didn't give you ^{F}quite enough infor^{C}mation \\
You didn't ^{D}count on me when you were counting on
your ^{F}rosary,      ^{F}oh ^{F}woah ^{C/E}woah
\end{bridge}

\begin{verse}
They _{F} say there's a heaven for _{G} those who will _{Am} wait, \\
Some _{F} say it's better but _{G} I say it _{C} ain't \\
I'd rather _{F} laugh with the sinners than _{G} cry with the _{C} saints, \\
The _{F} sinners are much more _{G} fun
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
You know that only the good _{C} die young, _{F} oh woah baby _{G} _{C} \\
I tell ya only the good _{F} die young, only the good _{G} die _{C} young
\end{chorus}

|_{G} & |_{F} & |_{C} & |_{C} &| _{D} & |_{D} & |_{F} & |_{F} &| \\

\begin{bridge}
You say your _{G} mother told you all that I could _{F} give you was a _{C} reputation \\
Aww she never _{D} cared for me,
but did she ever say a _{F} prayer for me?
_{G} oh _{F} woah _{C/E} woah
\end{bridge}

\begin{verse}
_{F} Come out come out come out Virginia _{G} don't let me _{Am} wait, \\
You _{F} catholic girls start _{G} much too _{C} late \\
_{F} Sooner or later it _{G} comes down to _{Am} fate \\

You know that only the good die _{C} young
