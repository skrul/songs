[Intro]
 
F  Bb  C  Bb
 
 
F                  Bb
A bottle of white, a bottle of red
C                     Bb        F
Perhaps a bottle of rose instead
C           C/Bb     Am
Get a table near the street
             Am/Bb  C
In our old familiar place
           Bb      C     Bb
You and I, face to face, um umm
F                Bb
A bottle of red, a bottle of white
C                      Bb  F
It all depends on your appetite
G             G/A     G/B C
I'll meet you anytime you want
        C/D C/E  F       Bb
In our Italian Restaurant

G
Things are okay with me these days
G
Got a good job, got a good office
C               Am7
Got a new wife, got a new life
        D             D D
And the family's fine
    G
Oh, we lost touch long ago
G
You lost weight I did not know
C              Am7                D
You could ever look so nice after so much time
 
 
         Eb                        Bb                 F
Do you remember those days hanging out at the village green
Eb                      Bb                     F
Engineer boots, leather jackets and tight blue jeans
                Eb                       Bb               F
Woah you drop a dime in the box play the song about New Orleans
Eb         Bb
Cold beer, hot lights
C          D              G
My sweet romantic teenage nights

G
Brenda and Eddie were the popular steadies
        D                             D C
And the king and the queen of the prom
G                      G/B                  C
Riding around with the car top down and the radio on
G                 D    D C
Nobody looked any finer
       G                    C
Or was more of a hit at the Parkway Diner
G                      F                          E
We never knew we could want more than that out of life
       Am         Am/B        C           D         G
Surely Brenda and Eddie would always know how to survive
 
 
   G/F    G/E    D
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
G      G/F    G/E    D
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
 
 
G                                              D                      D C
Brenda and Eddy were still going steady in the summer of seventy five
G                     G/B                      C
When they decided the marriage would be at the end of July
G                       D     D C
Everyone said they were crazy
G                           C
Brenda you know that you're much too lazy
G                   F                         E
Eddie could never afford to live that kind of life
        Am            Am/B   C          D         G
Oh, but there we were waving Brenda and Eddie goodbye
 
 
   G/F    G/E    D
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
 
 
           F
Well, they got an apartment with deep pile carpet
      D                        G
And a couple of paintings from Sears
  F
A big waterbed that they bought with the bread
         D                     G
They had saved for a couple of years
     F
They started to fight when the money got tight
         D                        Em         Am
And they just didn't count on the tears, woh oh, woh oh...yeah rock n roll

           G  D
           G  G/B  C
           G  D  D C
           G  C
           G  F  E
           Am  Am/B  C  D
 
 
G  G/F    G/E    D
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
 
 
           F
Well, they lived for a while in a very nice style
         D                         G
But it's always the same in the end
     F
They got a divorce as a matter of course
         D                            G
And they parted the closest of friends
         F
Then the king and the queen went back to the green
            D                    Em       Am     D
But you can never go back there again, oh oh, oh oh
 
 
G                                          D                     D C
Brenda and Eddie had had it already by the summer of seventy five
         G                      G/B
From the high to the low to the end of the show
        C
For the rest of their lives
     G                       D       D C
They couldn't go back to the greasers
    G                           C
The best they could do was pick up their pieces
G                         F                      E
We always knew they would both find a way to get by
Am           Am/B        C          D
That's all I heard about Brenda and Eddie
Am             Am/B         C          D
Can't tell you more cause I told you already
    Am          Am/B   C          D         G
And here we are waving Brenda and Eddie goodbye
 
 
   G/F    G/E    D
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
G  G/F    G/E    D
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
G  G/F    G/E    D
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
