\begin{verse}
Oh, when the ^{G}sun beats down and burns the tar up on the ^{D}roof \\
And your ^{D}shoes get so hot, you wish your tired feet were fire-^{G}proof \\
Under the ^{C}boardwalk, down by the ^{G}sea \\
On a ^{G}blanket ^{-}with my ba^{D}by, is where I'll ^{G}be
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
(Under the ^{Em}boardwalk) Out of the sun \\
(Under the ^{D}boardwalk) We'll be having some fun \\
(Under the ^{Em}boardwalk) People walking above \\
(Under the ^{D}boardwalk) We'll be making love under the ^*{Em*}board ^{Em*}walk, ^*{Em*}board ^{Em*}walk
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
From the ^{G}palms you hear the happy sounds of the carou^{D}sel \\
You can ^{D}almost taste the hot dogs and french fries they ^{G}sell \\
Under the ^{C}boardwalk, down by the ^{G}sea \\
On a ^{G}blanket ^{-}with my ba^{D}by, is where I'll ^{G}be
\end{verse}

(Under the ^{Em}boardwalk) Out of the sun \\
(Under the ^{D}boardwalk) We'll be having some fun \\
(Under the ^{Em}boardwalk) People walking above \\
(Under the ^{D}boardwalk) We'll be falling in love under the ^*{Em*}board ^{Em*}walk, ^*{Em*}board ^{Em*}walk
