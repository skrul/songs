\begin{verse}
City ^{A}sidewalks, busy sidewalks, dressed in ^{D}holiday style \\
In the ^{E}air there's a feeling of ^{A}Christmas \\
Children ^{A}laughing, people passing, meeting ^{D}smile after smile \\
And on ^{E}every street corner you ^{A}hear
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{A}Silver bells, oh ^{D}silver bells \\
^{E}It's Christmas time in the ^{A}city \\
I said ^{A}ring-a-ling, can't you ^{D}hear them ring, \\
^{E}Soon it will be Christmas ^{A}day
\end{chorus}

\end{solo}

\begin{verse}
Strings of ^{A}street lights, even stoplights, blink of ^{D}bright red and green \\
As the ^{E}shoppers rush home with their ^{A}presents \\
Hear the ^{A}snow crunch, see the kids bunch, this is ^{D}Santa's big scene \\
And a^{E}bove all the bustle you'll ^{A}hear
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{A}Silver bells, oh ^{D}silver bells \\
^{E}It's Christmas time in the ^{A}city \\
^{A}Ring-a-ling, oh can't you ^{D}hear them ring, \\
^{E}Soon it will be Christmas ^{A}day \\
^{E}Soon it will be Christmas ^{A}day \\
Woah and ^{E}soon it will be Christmas ^{A}day \\
\end{chorus}
