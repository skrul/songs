\begin{verse}
^{G} I sleep in late, ^{G} another day, ^{F} oh, what a wonder, ^{C} oh, what a waste \\
^{G} It's a Monday, ^{G} it's so mundane, ^{F} what exciting things will ha^{C}ppen today? \\
^{G} The yard is full of hard ru^{G}bbish, it's a mess and
^{F} I guess the neighbors must ^{C}think we run a meth lab \\
^{G} We should amend that, ^{G} I pull the sheets back, it's ^{F}40 degrees and I ^{C}feel like I'm dying \\
^{G} Life's getting hard in here so ^{G}I do some gardening, ^{F}anything to take my mind ^{C}away from where it's 'sposed to be \\
^{G} The nice lady next ^{G}door talks of green beds, and ^{F} all the nice things that she ^{C}wants to plant in them \\
^{G} I wanna grow to^{G}matoes on the front steps, ^{F}sunflowers, bean sprouts, ^{C}sweet corn and radishes \\
^{G} I feel proactive, ^{G} I pull out weeds, ^{F} all of a sudden I'm ^{C}having trouble breathing ^{G}in  \\
I'm having trouble breathing ^{F}in, I'm ^{C}having trouble breathing ^{G}in,  I'm having trouble breathing ^{F}in,  ^{C}

\begin{verse}
^{G} My hands are shaky, ^{G} my knees are weak, ^{F} I can't seem to stand on my ^{C}own two feet \\
I'm ^{G}breathing but I'm wheezing, feel ^{G}like I'm emphysem-in, my throat ^{F}feels like a funnel filled with ^{C}Weet-Bix and kerosene and \\
^{G} Oh no, next thing I ^{G}know they call up triple O, ^{F} I'd rather die than owe the ^{C}hospital till I get old \\
^{G} I get adrenaline ^{G}straight to the heart, I ^{F}feel like Uma Thurman
post-^{C}overdosing kick start \\
^{G} Reminds me of the time when ^{G}I was really sick and I had ^{F}too much pseudoephedrine and I ^{C} couldn't sleep at night \\
^{G} Halfway down High Street ^{G}Andy looks ambivalent, he's ^{F}probably wondering what I'm doing ^{C}getting in an ambulance \\
^{G} The paramedic thinks I'm ^{G}clever cos I play guitar, ^{F} I think she's clever cos she ^{C}  stops people dying \\
^{G} Anaphylactic and  ^{G}super hypochondriactic, ^{F}should've stayed in bed today I ^{C}much prefer the mundane \\
^{G} I take a hit from ^{G} an asthma puffer, ^{F} I do it wrong I was ^{C}never good at smoking ^{G}bongs \\
I'm not that good at breathing ^{F}in, I'm ^{C}not that good at breathing ^{G}in, I'm not that good at breathing ^{F}in  ^{C}
