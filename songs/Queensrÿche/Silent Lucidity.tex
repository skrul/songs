\begin{verse}
^{G}Hush now, don't you cry,
Wipe away the ^{Em}teardrop from your eye \\
^{G}You're lying safe in bed,
It was all a bad dream
^{Em}spinning in your head \\
^{C}Your mind tricked you to feel the pain, \\of someone close to ^{Am}you leaving the game of life \\
^{C}So here it is, another chance,
wide awake you ^{Am}face the day \\
Your dream is over... or has it just begun?
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
^{G}There's a place I like to hide \\
A doorway that I ^{Em}run through in the night \\
^{G}Relax child, you were there \\
But only didn't ^{Em}realize and you were scared \\
^{C}It's a place where you will learn \\
To face your fears, ^{Am}retrace the years \\
And ride the whims of your mind \\
^{C}Commanding in another world \\
Suddenly you ^{Am}hear and see \\
This magic new dimension
\end{verse}
 
 
\begin{chorus}
^{D}I... will be watching over ^{C}you \\
^{D}I... am gonna help you see it ^{C}through \\
^{D}I.. will protect you in the ^{C}night \\
I... am smiling next to you, in Silent Lucidity ^{G}
\end{chorus}

(Spoken during solo)
 
(Visualize your dream)
(Record it in the present tense)
(Put it into a permanent form)
(If you persist in your efforts)
(You can achieve dream control)
(Dream control)
(How are we feeling today, better??)
(Dream control, dream control)
(Help me)

\begin{verse}
^{G}If you open your mind for me \\
You won't rely on ^{Em}open eyes to see \\
^{G}The walls you built within \\
Come tumbling down, and a ^{Em}new world will begin \\
^{C}Living twice at once you learn \\
You're safe from pain ^{Am}in the dream domain \\
A soul set free to fly \\
^{C}A round trip journey in your head \\
Master of ^{Am}illusion, can you realize \\
Your dream's alive, you can be the guide but...
\end{verse} 

\begin{chorus}
^{D}I... will be watching over ^{C}you \\
^{D}I... am gonna help you see it ^{C}through \\
^{D}I.. will protect you in the ^{C}night \\
^{D}I... am smiling next to ^{C}you.... ^{G} ^{Em}
