\begin{bridge}
\instruction{spoken}
Gaze into the darkness of endless space \\
Time curves and twirls, shattering one's ego \\
Changing is forever (Hey, that's pretty good)
\end{bridge}

\begin{verse}
Cool, you went insane (Cool) \\
What's the weather like in your brain? \\
You're saying that I'm your last chance \\
Shaking your fist into the sky \\
You seem to think I'm a God or \\
Something really grand and gold, well \\
Maybe if you make it here alone \\
I'll help you out
\end{verse}

\begin{prechorus}
And help me out (And help me out) \\
And help me out (And help me out) \\
And help me out (And help me out)
\end{prechorus}

[Chorus]
I've never felt this lonely
Come on and hold me
Solar system, help me out
Hold me with your velvet
Shiny planets
Solar system, help me out

[Bridge]
Solar system, help me out
I've never felt this lonely
(Solar system, help me out)
Solar system, help me out
(Solar system)

[Outro]
And help me out
And help me out
And help me out
And help me out
(Solar system)
[Outro 2 Spoken]
We first flew in 1903
And on the moon by 1969
Life passes in a blink of an eye
There's no harm in giving it a try
