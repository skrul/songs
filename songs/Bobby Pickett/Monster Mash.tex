\instruction{Door opens, chains dragging behind steps, drums} 
\end{intro}

\begin{verse}
I was ^{G}working in the lab late one night,
when my ^{Em}eyes beheld an eerie sight. \\
For my ^{C}monster from his slab began to rise,
and ^{D}suddenly to my surprise
\end{verse} 

\begin{chorus}
\begin{tabbing}
He did the ^{G}mash, he did the monster mash \space\space\space\=
The monster ^{Em}mash, it was a graveyard smash \\
He did the ^{C}mash, it caught on in a flash\>
He did the ^{D}mash, he did the monster mash
\end{tabbing}
\end{chorus} 

\begin{verse}
\begin{tabbing}
From my ^{G}laboratory in the castle east, \=
to the ^{Em}master bedroom where the vampires feast \\
(Wa-ooh) \>
(Wa-ooh) \\
The ^{C}ghouls all came from their humble abodes, \=
to ^{D}catch a jolt from my electrodes \\
(Wa-wa-ooh) \>
(Wa-oh!)
\end{tabbing}
\end{verse} 

\begin{chorus}
\begin{tabbing}
They did the ^{G}mash, they did the monster mash \space\space\ \=
The monster ^{Em}mash, it was a graveyard smash \\
They did the ^{C}mash, it caught on in a flash \>
They did the ^{D}mash, they did the monster mash
\end{tabbing}
\end{chorus} 

\begin{bridge}
\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{20pt} The ^{C}zombies were having fun... \= \hspace{60pt} the ^{D}party had just begun \\
(Wa-ooh) \>
(and a shoop wa-ooh) \\
\hspace{60pt} The ^{C}guests included Wolf Man... \= \hspace{60pt} ^{D*}Dracula and his son \\
(and a shoop wa-ooh) \>
(and a shoop wa-oh!) \\
\end{tabbing}
\end{bridge}

\begin{verse}
\begin{tabbing}
The ^{G}scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds, \=
^{Em}Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds \\
(Wa-ooh) \>
(Wa-ooh) \\
The ^{C}Coffin-Bangers were about to arrive, \=
with their ^{D}vocal group, "The Crypt-Kicker Five." \\
(Wa-wa-ooh) \>
(Wa-oh!)
\end{tabbing}
\end{verse} 

\begin{chorus}
\begin{tabbing}
They played the ^{G}mash, they played the monster mash \space\space\space\=
The monster ^{Em}mash, it was a graveyard smash \\
They played the ^{C}mash, it caught on in a flash \>
They played the ^{D}mash, they played the monster mash
\end{tabbing}
\end{chorus} 

\begin{verse}
\begin{tabbing}
^{G}Out from his coffin, Drac's voice did ring, \=
^{Em}seems he was troubled by just one thing \\
(Wa-ooh) \>
(Wa-ooh) \\
He ^{C}opened the lid and shook his fist, \=
and said, ^{D*} "Whatever happened to my Transylvanian Twist?" \\
(Wa-wa-ooh) \>
\hspace{20pt}(Wa-oh!)
\end{tabbing}
\end{verse} 

\begin{chorus}
\begin{tabbing}
It's now the ^{G}mash, it's now the monster mash  \space\space\ \=
The monster ^{Em}mash, and it's a graveyard smash \\
It's now the ^{C}mash, it's caught on in a flash \>
It's now the ^{D}mash, it's now the monster mash
\end{tabbing}
\end{chorus} 

\begin{verse}
\begin{tabbing}
Now ^{G}everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band, \=
and my ^{Em}monster mash is the hit of the land \\
(Wa-ooh) \>
(Wa-ooh) \\
For ^{C}you, the living, this mash was meant too, \=
when you ^{D*}get to my door, tell them Boris sent you \\
(Wa-wa-ooh) \>
(Wa-oh!)
\end{tabbing}
\end{verse} 

\begin{chorus}
\begin{tabbing}
Then you can ^{G}mash, then you can monster mash  \space\space\ \=
The monster ^{Em}mash, and do my graveyard smash \\
Then you can ^{C}mash, you'll catch on in a flash, \>
Then you can ^{D}mash, then you can monster mash
