\begin{verse}	
I've never seen a ^{D}diamond in the flesh \\
I cut my ^{D}teeth on wedding rings in the movies \\
And I'm not ^{D}proud of my address \\
In the torn up ^{D}town, no postcode envy
\end{verse} 

\begin{prechorus}
But every song's like: ^{D}gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom \\
 
^{D}Blood stains, ballgowns, trashin' the hotel room \\
^{C}We don't care; we're driving ^{G}Cadillacs in our dreams \\
But everybody's like ^{D}Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
^{D}Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash  \\
^{C}We don't care; we aren't ^{G}caught up in your love affair
\end{prechorus}

\begin{chorus}
And we'll never be ^{D}royals (royals), it don't run in our blood \\
That kind of ^{C}lux just ain't for us  \\
We crave a ^{G}different kind of buzz \\
Let me be your ^{D}ruler (ruler) - you can call me queen bee \\
And baby I'll ^{C}rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule) ^{G} \\
Let me live that fantasy ^{D}
\end{chorus}
 
\begin{verse}
My friends and ^{D}I we've cracked the code \\
We count our ^{D}dollars on the train to the party \\
And every^{D}one who knows us knows \\
That we're fine with this \\
We didn't come from money
\end{verse}

\begin{bridge}
^{D}Oh ooh oh ohh \\
We're ^{C}bigger than we ever dreamed \\
And I'm in love ^{G}with being queen (king) \\
^{D}oh ooh oh ohh \\
^{C}Life is great without a care \\
We aren't ^{G}caught up in your love affair
