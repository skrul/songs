 \begin{verse}
As I ^{Ab}walk through the valley of the ^{Fm}shadow of death,
I take a ^{G}look at my life and rea^{Cm}lize there's nothin' left \\
Cause ^{Ab}I've been blasting and ^{Fm}laughing so long,
that ^{G}even my mama thinks that my ^{Cm}mind is gone \\
But I ain't ^{Ab}never crossed a man that ^{Fm}didn't deserve it,
me be ^{G}treated like a punk you ^{Cm}know that's unheard of \\
You ^{Ab}better watch how you're talking ^{Fm}and where you're walking
or ^{G}you and your homies might be ^{Cm}lined in chalk \\
I ^{Ab}really hate to trip but I ^{Fm}gotta loc,
as they ^{G}croak I see myself in the ^{Cm}pistol smoke, fool \\
^{Ab}I'm the kinda G the little ^{Fm}homies wanna be like
on my ^{G}knees in the night saying ^{Cm}prayers in the streetlight
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{Ab} Been spending ^{Fm}most their lives, living ^{G}in the gangsta's ^{Cm}paradise \\
^{Ab} Been spending ^{Fm}most their lives, living ^{G}in the gangsta's ^{Cm}paradise \\
^{Ab} Keep spending ^{Fm}most our lives, living ^{G}in the gangsta's ^{Cm}paradise \\
^{Ab} Keep spending ^{Fm}most our lives, living ^{G}in the gangsta's ^{Cm}paradise
\end{chorus} 

\begin{verse}
Look at the situation they got me facin',
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the streets \\
So I gotta be down with the hood team;
too much television watching got me chasing dreams \\
I'm an educated fool with money on my mind,
got my 10 in my hand and a gleam in my eye \\
I'm a loc'd out gangsta set trippin' banger
and my homies is down so don't arouse my anger, fool \\
Death ain't nothing but a heartbeat away,
I'm living life, do or die, what can I say \\
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24,
the way things are going I don't know
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Power and the money, money and the power,
minute after minute, hour after hour \\
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't looking
what's going on in the kitchen, \mbox{but I don't know what's cookin'} \\
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me \\
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool
