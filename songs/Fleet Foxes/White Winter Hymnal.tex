\begin{intro}
\instruction{A cappella} \\
I was following the, I was following the \\
I was following the, I was following the \\
I was following the, I was following the \\
I was following the, I was following the
\end{intro}

\begin{verse}
^{E}I was following the ^{E}pack all swallowed in their ^{E}coats \\
With scarves of ^{E}red tied 'round their ^{F#m}throats \\
To keep their little ^{F#m}heads, from fallin' in the ^{F#m}snow \\
And I turn '^{F#m}round and there you ^{A}go, and Michael you would ^{A}fall \\
And turn the ^{B7}white snow red as ^{B7}strawberries in the ^{(E)}summertime
\end{verse}

\instruction{A cappella} \\
^{E*}I was following the pack all swallowed in their coats \\
With scarves of red tied 'round their throats \\
To keep their little heads, from fallin' in the snow \\
And I turn 'round and there you go, and Michael you would fall \\
And turn the white snow red as strawberries in the summertime
