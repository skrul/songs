\begin{verse}
Blame it ^{A}all on my roots,
I ^{Bbdim7}showed up in boots,
and ^{Bm}ruined your black tie a^{Bm}ffair  \\
The ^{E}last one to know, the ^{E}last one to show, I was the ^{A}last one you thought you'd see ^{A}there \\
And I ^{A}saw the surprise, and the ^{Bbdim7}fear in his eyes, when ^{Bm}I took his glass of cham^{Dm7}pagne \\
^{E}I toasted you, said honey ^{E}we may be through, but ^{E}you'll never hear me comp^{E}lain
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
'Cause ^{A}I got friends in ^{A}low places \\
 Where the ^{A}whiskey drowns and the ^{A}beer chases \\
My b^{Bm}lues away, ^{Bm} and I'll ^{E}be okay ^{E} \\
Yeah, ^{A}I'm not big on ^{A}social graces \\
Think I'll ^{A}slip on down to the o^{A7}asis \\
Oh, ^{Bm}I've got friends^{E}  \\
In low p^{A}laces ^{A}
\end{chorus}

\end{solo}

\begin{verse}
Well I ^{A}guess I was wrong, I ^{Bbdim7}just don't belong, but ^{Bm}then, I've been there be^{Bm}fore \\
Every^{E}thing's alright, I'll ^{E}just say goodnight, and I'll ^{A}show myself to the ^{A}door \\
Hey ^{A}I didn't mean to ^{Bbdim7}cause a big scene, just ^{Bm}give me an hour and ^{Dm7}then \\
^{E}I'll be as high as that ^{E}ivory tower ^{E} that you're livin' ^{E}in
