^{F}  There's no combi^{F/E}nation of words
I could ^{Dm}put on the back of a ^{Dm/C}postcard \\
^{A#}  No song that I^{F/A} could sing,
but ^{Gm}I can try for ^{C}your heart, \\
^{F} Our ^{F/E}dreams, and they are ^{Dm}made out of real ^{Dm/C}things \\
Like a ^{A#}shoe box of p^{F/A}hotographs
with ^{Gm}sepia-toned ^{C}loving \\
^{F} Love is the ^{F/E}answer
at least for ^{Dm}most of the questions in ^{Dm/C}my heart like \\
^{A#}  Why are we h^{F/A}ere? And where do we g^{Gm}o?
And how come it's ^{C}so hard? \\
^{F}  It's not always ^{F/E}easy and
sometimes ^{Dm}life can be de^{Dm/C}ceiving \\
^{A#}  I'll tell you one t^{F/A}hing, it's always b^{Gm}etter when we're tog^{C}ether

And all of these ^{F}moments
just might ^{F/E}find their way into my ^{Dm}dreams tonight^{Dm/C}, \\
But I ^{A#}know that they’ll be g^{F/A}one
when the ^{Gm}morning light ^{C}sings \\
And brings ^{F}new things ^{F/E}
for to^{Dm}morrow night you ^{Dm/C}see  \\
That ^{A#}they’ll be gone t^{F/A}oo,
too many ^{Gm}things I have to ^{C}do \\
But if all of these ^{F}dreams might find ^{F/E}their way
into my ^{Dm}day to day scen^{Dm/C}e    \\
I'd be ^{A#}under the impr^{F/A}ession
I was ^{Gm}somewhere in bet^{C}ween \\
With only ^{F}two,
just me and ^{F/E}you,
not so many ^{Dm}things we got to ^{Dm/C}do \\
Or ^{A#}places we got to b^{F/A}e 
we'll sit be^{Gm}neath the mango ^{C}tree, now
