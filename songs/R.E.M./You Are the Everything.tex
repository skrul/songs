\begin{verse}
Some^{G}times I feel like I can't even ^{D}sing \\
I'm very scared for ^{G}this world, I'm very scared for ^{D}me \\
Eviscerate your ^{G}memory, here's a scene, you're ^{D}in the back seat laying down \\
The ^{G}windows wrap around you the ^{D}sound of the travel and the ^{C}engine \\
All you hear is ^{G}time stand still in ^{C}travel \\
You feel such peace and ^{G}absolute, \\
The stillness still that ^{C}doesn't end, but slowly drifts ^{G}into sleep \\
\lyric{1}{
The stars are the ^{D}greatest thing you've ever seen, and ^{D}they're there for you \\
& For ^{D}you alone, you ^{D}are the every^{(G)}thing \\

\begin{verse}
^{G} I think about this ^{D}world a lot and I cry \\
And ^{G}I've seen the films and the ^{D}eyes \\
But I'm in this ^{G}kitchen, everything is ^{D}beautiful \\
And she is so ^{G}beautiful, she is so young and ^{D}old \\
I look at her and ^{C}I see the beauty of the ^{G}light of music \\
The ^{C}voice is talking somewhere in the ^{G}house late spring\\
And you're ^{C}drifting off to sleep with your ^{G}teeth in your mouth \\
^{D}You are here with me \\
^{D}You are here with me \\
^{D}You have been here and ^{D}you are every^{(Am)}thing
