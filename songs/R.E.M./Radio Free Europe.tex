\begin{song}[transpose-capo=true]{title={Radio Free Europe}, band={R.E.M.}, year={1983}, key={}, tempo={155}}

\begin{verse}
Decide yourself if radio's gonna stay \\
Reason it could polish up the gray \\
Put that, put that, put that up your wall \\
That this isn't coun-try at all
\end{verse}

\begin{prechorus}
Raving station (hold aaaaaaan) \\
Beside yourself (hold ellllllf)
\end{prechorus}

\begin{verse}
Keep me out of country in the word \\
Deal the porch is leading us absurd \\
Push that, push that, push that to the hull \\
That this isn't nooooo-thing at all
\end{verse}

\begin{prechorus}
Straight off the boat (aaat) \\
Where to go? (goooo)
\end{prechorus}

\begin{chorus}
Calling on in transit, calling on in transit \\
Radio Free Europe, radio...
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
Beside defying media too fast \\
Instead of pushing palaces to fall \\
Put that, put that, put that before ----- all \\
That this isn't fortunate --- at all
\end{verse}

\begin{prechorus}
Raving station (hold aaaaaaan) \\
Beside yourself (hold ellllllf)
\end{prechorus}

\begin{chorus}
Calling on in transit, calling on in transit \\
Radio Free Europe, radio...
\end{chorus}

\begin{bridge}
Decide yourself, calling all of the ---- medias too fast
\end{bridge}

\begin{verse}
Keep me out of country in the word \\
Disappoint is into us absurd
\end{verse}

\begin{prechorus}
Straight off the boat (oooooooat) \\
Where to go? (gooooo)
\end{prechorus}

\begin{chorus}
Calling on in transit, calling on in transit \\
Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Europe \\
\\
Calling on in transit, calling on in transit \\
Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Europe
\end{chorus}
