\begin{verse}
^{G} That's great, it starts with an ^{Cmaj7}earthquake, \\
Birds and snakes, an ^{G}aeroplane ^{'}- Lenny Bruce is ^{Cmaj7}not afraid \\
^{G}Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn, 
^{Cmaj7}world serves its own needs, don't misserve your own needs. ^{'} \\
^{G}Speed it up a knock, speed, grunt, no, strength. The ^{Cmaj7}ladder starts to clatter with fear of height, down height. \\
^{Bb}Wire in a fire, representing seven games and a ^{Am}government for hire and a combat site. \\
^{G}Left of west and coming in a hurry with the Furies breathing ^{Cmaj7}down your neck. \\
^{G}Team by team reporters baffled, trumped, tethered, cropped. Look at ^{Cmaj7}that low plane,  fine then. \\
^{G}Uh oh, overflow, population, common food, but ^{Cmaj7}it'll do. Save yourself, serve yourself. \\
World serves its ^{G}own needs, listen to your heart bleed.
Tell me with the ^{Cmaj7}Rapture \scalebox{0.99}[1.0]{and the reverent in the right, right} \\
You ^{Bb}vitriolic, patriotic, slam fight, bright light, ^{Am}feeling pretty psyched.
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus}
It's the ^{G}end o^{-}f the ^{Dsus2}world as we ^{Am}know it \\
It's the ^{G}end o^{-}f the ^{Dsus2}world as we ^{Am}know it \\
It's the ^{G}end o^{-}f the ^{Dsus2}world as we ^{Am}know it and I feel ^{C}fine  ^{C}
\end{chorus} 
 
\begin{verse}
^{G}Six o'clock, TV hour.  Don't get caught in foreign tower.
^{Cmaj7}Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn. \\
^{G}Lock him in uniform, book burning, blood letting.
^{Cmaj7}Every motive escalate.  Automotive incinerate. \\
^{G}Light a candle, light a votive.  Step down, step down.
^{Cmaj7}Watch your heel crush, crush. Uh oh. \\
This means ^{G}no fear cavalier renegade and steering clear!
A ^{Cmaj7}tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies. \\
^{Bb}Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives and ^{Am}I decline.
\end{verse} 

\begin{chorus}
It's the ^{G}end o^{-}f the ^{Dsus2}world as we ^{Am}know it \\
It's the ^{G}end o^{-}f the ^{Dsus2}world as we ^{Am}know it \\
It's the ^{G}end o^{-}f the ^{Dsus2}world as we ^{Am}know it and I feel ^{C}fine \\
^{G} I feel ^{Cmaj7}fine  ^{G}  ^{Cmaj7}   ^{G}  ^{F} ^{F}  \\

^{G}The other night I dreamed of knives, continental drift divide.
^{Cmaj7}Mountains sit ^{-}in a line, ^{N.C.}Leonard Bernstein. \\

^{Cmaj7}Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly bean, boom! \\
