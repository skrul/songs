\begin{verse}
As ^{C}soon as I get my ^{C}head 'round you, I ^{C}come around catching ^{C}sparks off you \\
I ^{C}get an electric ^{C}charge from you, a ^{C}second hand living it ^{C}just won't ^{(C)}do

\begin{chorus}
And the ^{F}way I feel to^{G}night, I could ^{C}die and I wouldn't ^{F}mind \\
And there's ^{F}something going on in^{G}side... \\
\\
^{C}Makes you wanna feel, ^{C}makes you wanna try, ^{F}makes you blow the ^{G}stars from the sky \\
And I ^{C}can't stand up, I ^{C}can't cool down, I ^{F}can't get my head ^{G}off the ^{(C)}ground

\begin{verse}
^{C}As soon as I get my ^{C}head 'round you, I ^{C}come around catching ^{C}sparks off you \\
And ^{C}all I ever ^{C}got from you, is ^{C}all I ever ^{C}took from ^{(C)}you \\
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
Yeah the ^{F}world could die in ^{G}pain, and ^{C}I wouldn't feel no ^{F}shame \\
And there's ^{F}nothing holding me to ^{G}blame... \\
\\
^{C}Makes you wanna feel, ^{C}makes you wanna try, ^{F}makes you blow the ^{G}stars from the sky \\
And I'm ^{C}taking myself to the ^{C}dirty part of town, where ^{F}all my troubles ^{G}can't be  \\
^{C}Found... ^{C} I say ^{F}yeah, yeah, yeah^{G}
