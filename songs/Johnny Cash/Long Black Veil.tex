\begin{verse}
^{C} Ten years a-^{C}go on a ^{C}cold dark ^{C}night \\
^{G} Someone was ^{G}killed beneath the ^{F}town hall ^{C}light \\
There were ^{C}few at the ^{C}scene but they ^{C}all a^{C}greed \\
That the ^{G}slayer who ^{G}ran looked a ^{F}lot like ^{C}me ^{C}
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
She ^{F}walks these ^{C}hills in a ^{F}long black ^{C}veil ^{C} \\
She ^{F}visits my ^{C}grave when the ^{F}night winds ^{C}wail ^{C} ^{C} ^{C} \\
^{C} Nobody ^{C}knows ^{F} nobody ^{C}sees \\
^{F} Nobody ^{G}knows but ^{C}me ^{C}
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
The ^{C}judge said son ^{C} what is your ^*{C}al-ib ^{C}i \\
If you were ^{G}somewhere ^{G}else then ^{F}you won't have to ^{C}die \\
I ^{C}spoke not a ^{C}word though it ^{C}meant my ^{C}life \\
For I had ^{G}been in the ^{G}arms of my ^{F}best friend's ^{C}wife ^{C}
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Now the ^{C}scaffold's ^{C}high and e^{C}ternity ^{C}near \\
^{G} She stood in the ^{G}crowd and ^{F}shed not a ^{C}tear \\
But ^{C}sometimes at ^{C}night when the ^{C}cold wind ^{C}blows \\
In a ^{G}long black ^{G}veil she ^{F}cries over my ^{C}bones ^{C}
\end{verse}

\begin{outro}
^{C} Nobody ^{C}knows ^{F} nobody ^{C}sees \\
^{F} Nobody ^{G}knows but ^{C*}me
