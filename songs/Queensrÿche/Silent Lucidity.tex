\begin{verse}
^{G} Hush now, don't you cry, wipe away the ^{Em}teardrop from your eye \\
^{G} You're lying safe in bed, it was all a bad dream ^{Em}spinning in your head \\
^{C} Your mind tricked you to feel the pain, of someone close to ^{Am}you leaving the game of life \\
^{C} So here it is, another chance,
wide awake you ^{Am}face the day, your dream is over ^{G*}... \\
^{N.C}Or has it just begun?
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
^{G} There's a place I like to hide, a doorway that I ^{Em}run through in the night \\
^{G} Relax child, you were there, but only didn't ^{Em}realize and you were scared \\
^{C} It's a place where you will learn, to face your fears, re^{Am}trace the years and ride the whims of your mind \\
^{C} Commanding in another world, suddenly you ^{Am}hear and see this magic new dimension
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus}
\begin{tabbing}
^{D}I... ^{C} will be watching over you \hspace{30pt} \= ^{D}I... ^{C} am gonna help you see it through \\

\begin{verse}
^{G} If you open your mind for me, you won't rely on ^{Em}open eyes to see \\
^{G} The walls you built within come tumbling down, and a ^{Em}new world will begin \\
^{C} Living twice at once you learn, you're safe from pain in the ^{Am}dream domain, a soul set free to fly \\
^{C} A round trip journey in your head, master of ^{Am}illusion, \scalebox{0.9}[1.0]{can you realize, your dream's alive, you can be the guide but...}
