\begin{verse}
^{Bb/D} If I wanted to know who you were ^{Csus4}hanging with while I was gone, I would have asked you \\
^{Bb/D} It's the kind of cold, fogs up ^{Csus4}windshield glass but I felt it when I passed you \\
^{Bb/D} There's an ache in you, put there by the ^{Csus4}ache in me \\
^{Bb/D} But if it's all the same to you, it's the ^{Csus4}same to me
\end{verse} 

\begin{chorus}
So we could call it ^{F}even, you could call me "babe" for the weekend, ^{F} 'Tis the damn season, \\
Write this ^{Dm}down, I'm stayin' at my parents' house, and the ^{Dm}road not taken looks real good now \\
And it ^{C}always leads to you in my ^{C}hometown
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
^{Bb/D} I parked my car right between the ^{Csus4}Methodist and the school that used to be ours \\
^{Bb/D} The holidays linger like ^{Csus4}bad perfume, you can run, but only so far \\
^{Bb/D} I escaped it too, remember how you ^{Csus4}watched me leave \\
^{Bb/D} But if it's okay with you, it's o^{Csus4}kay with me
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
So we could call it ^{F}even, you could call me "babe" for the weekend, ^{F} 'Tis the damn season, \\
Write this ^{Dm}down, I'm stayin' at my parents' house, and the ^{Dm}road not taken looks real good now \\
^{F} Time flies, messy as the mud on your ^{F}truck tires, now I'm missing your smile, \\
Hear me ^{Dm}out, we could just ride around, and the ^{Dm}road not taken looks real good now \\
And it ^{C}always leads to you in my ^{C}hometown
\end{chorus}

\newpage

\begin{bridge}
^{F} Sleep in half the day ^{Dm} just for old times' sake \\
^{C} I won't ask you to wait if you ^{C}don't ask me to stay \\
So I'll go back to ^{F}L.A. and the so-called friends who'll write ^{F}books about me, if I ever make it \\
And ^{Dm}wonder about the only soul who can ^{Dm}tell which smiles I'm fakin’ \\
And the h^{C}eart I know I'm breakin' is my ^{C}own  \\
To ^{Bb/D}leave the warmest bed I've ever ^{C}known \\
We could call ^{Bb/D} it even ^{C}  \\
Even though ^{Bb/D} I'm leavin’ ^{C}  \\
And I'll be yours for the ^{Bb/D}weekend, 'tis the damn ^{C}season
