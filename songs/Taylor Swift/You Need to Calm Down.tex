\begin{verse}
^{D}You are somebod-y that I don't know,
but you're ^{D}takin' shots at me like it's Patr√≥n \\
And I'm just like "^{G}Damn, it's 7 a.^{G}m." \\
^{D}Say it in the street, that's a knock-out,
but you ^{D}say it in a tweet, that's a cop-out \\
And I'm just like "^{G}Hey, are you o^{G}kay?"
\end{verse} 
 
\begin{prechorus}
And ^{D}I-ain't tryna mess with your self-expression but I've learned a les^{D}son \\
That stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no ^{G}fun \\
And ^{A*}snakes and stones never broke my bones
\end{prechorus} 

\begin{chorus}
So ^{D}oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, ^{D}oh-oh \\
You need to calm ^{G}down, you're being too ^{G}loud \\
And I'm just like ^{D}oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, ^{D}oh-oh (oh!) \\
You need to just s^{G}top, like can you just ^{G}not step on my gown? \\
You need to calm ^{D}down ^{D}
\end{chorus} 

\begin{verse}
^{D}You are somebod-y that we don't know,
but you're ^{D}comin' at my friends like a missile \\
Why are you ^{G}mad, when you could be ^{G}GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD) \\
^{D}Sunshine on the street at the pa-rade,
but ^{D}you would rather be in the dark ages \\
Makin' that s^{G}ign, must've taken all ^{G}night
\end{verse} 

\begin{prechorus}
^{D}You just need to take several seats and then try to re-store the pea^{D}ce \\
And control your urges to scream about all the people you ^{G}hate \\
'Cause ^{A*}shade never made anybody less gay
\end{prechorus}

\begin{chorus}
So ^{D}oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, ^{D}oh-oh \\
You need to calm ^{G}down, you're being too ^{G}loud \\
And I'm just like ^{D}oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, ^{D}oh-oh (oh!) \\
You need to just s^{G}top, like can you just ^{G}not step on his gown? \\
You need to calm ^{D}down
\end{chorus} 

\begin{bridge}
And we see you over there on the internet \\
^{D} Comparing all the girls who are killin' it \\
^{G} But we figured you out, we all know ^{G}now \\
We all got crowns, you need to calm (^{(N.C.)}down)
\end{bridge} 
 
\begin{chorus}
^{N.C.}Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, ^{N.C.}oh-oh \\
You need to calm ^{G}down, (you need to calm down) you're being too ^{G}loud (you're being too loud)\\
And I'm just like ^{D}oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, ^{D}oh-oh (oh!) \\
You need to just s^{G}top, (can you just stop?) like can you just ^{G}not step on our gowns? \\
You need to calm ^{D*}down
