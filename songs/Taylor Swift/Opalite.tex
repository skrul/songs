it's never gonna ^{D/F#}last \\
I thought my house was ^{C}haunted, \hspace{10pt} ^{C} ^{-} I ^{D(add11)}used to live with ^{C}ghosts ^{C} ^{-} ^{D(add11)} \\
And all the perfect ^{C}couples ^{C} sa^{-}id "^{D(add11)}When you know you ^{C/E}know" and "when you don't you ^{D/F#}don't"

Sleepless in the ^{Am7}onyx night, ^{Am7} but now the sky is ^{Dsus4}opalite, o^{D}h oh oh oh \\
^{G}Oh my Lord, n^{G}ever made no one like ^{Em7}you before ^{Em7} \\
You had to make your ^{Am7}own sunshine ^{Am7} But now the sky is ^{Dsus4}opalite, ^{D}Oh oh oh oh oh \\

\begin{verse}
You couldn't under^{C}stand it ^{C} ^{-} ^{D(add11)}why you felt ^{C}alone ^{C} ^{-} ^{D(add11)} \\
You were in it ^{C}for real ^{C} ^{-} ^{D(add11)}She was in her ^{C/E}phone, and you were just a ^{D/F#}pose
\\
And don't we try to ^{C}love love? ^{C} ^{-} ^{D(add11)} We give it all we ^{C}got (give it all we ^*{C}got ^{-})  ^{D(add11)} \\
You finally left the ^{C}table, ^{C} a^{-}nd ^{D(add11)}what a simple ^{C/E}thought, you're starving til you're ^{D/F#}not

\end{chorus}

\begin{bridge}
^{G}If... this is ^{G}just... a storm inside a ^{Em}tea - ^{Em}cup \\
But shelter here with ^{Am9}me, my ^{Am}love \\
Thunder like a ^{D}drum this life will beat you ^{D}up, up, up, up \\
^{G}This... is ^{G}just a temporary ^{Em}speed ^{Em}bump \\
But failure brings you ^{Am9}free - ^{Am}dom \\
And I can bring you ^{D}love, ^{D7}love, ^{D7}love, ^{D7}love, ^{D7*}love \\
^{N.C.}Don't you sweat it, baby
