The moon is ^{D}high -
like your friends were the ^{D}night that we first ^{D}met \\
Went home and tried to ^{.D}stalk you on the ^{D*}in- ^{A*}ter- ^{Bm}net \\
Now I've read all of the ^{Bm}books beside your ^{A} bed ^{A} \\
\\
The wine is ^{D}cold -
like the shoulder that I ^{D}gave you in the ^{D}street \\
Cat and mouse for a ^{.D}month or ^{D*}two ^{A*}or ^{Bm}three \\
Now I wake up in the ^{Bm}night and watch you ^{A} breathe ^{A}
\end{verse}

(^{D}Ay!) Kiss me once 'cause you ^{D}know I had a long night \\
(^{D}Oh!) Kiss me twice 'cause it's ^{.D}gonna be ^{D*}all ^{A*}right \\
(^{Bm}Uh!) Three times 'cause I've ^{Bm}waited my whole life \\

^{D} In the winter in the ^{D}icy outdoor ^{D}pool \\
When you ^{.D}jumped in first, I ^{D*}went ^{A*}in ^{Bm}too \\
I'm with ^{Bm}you even if it makes me ^{A} blue ^{A} \\
Which takes me b^{D}ack - to the color that we ^{D}painted your brother's ^{D}wall \\
Honey, without all the ^{.D}exes, ^{D*}fights ^{A*}and ^{Bm}flaws \\
We wouldn't be ^{Bm}standing here so^{A} tall ^{A} so
