^{Ab}Tell me a line, make it easy for me \\
^{Ab}Open your arms, dance with me until I feel all ^{Db}right ^{Db} \\

^{Ab}It's good in the dark, good in the dark \\
^{Ab}But into the lover's light, here comes another ^{Db}fight ^{Db}

^{Ab}So ring the alarm, ring the alarm \\
^{Ab}Bore me and hold me and cling to my arm, here it ^{Db}comes, here it ^{Db}comes \\

And what you're ^{Ab}asking me now, disastrous now \\
^{Ab}Hoping and hoping and hoping the feeling goes ^{Db}away ^{Db}

^{Ab}And smashing the pride, the morning's got you on the ^{Db}ropes, ^{Db}ooh \\

^{Ab}And love is a murderer, love is a murderer \\
^{Ab}But if she calls you tonight, everything is all ^{Db}right, yeah, we ^{Db}knoooooow \\

And ^{Ab}love is a curse shoved in a hearse \\^{Ab}Love is an open book to a verse of your ^{Db}bad poetry, and this is ^{Db}coming from me
