Ab
Tell me a line make it easy for me
 
Open your arms
                                 Db
Dance with me until I feel all right
 
Ab
It's good in the dark, good in the dark
 
But into the lover's light
                      Db
Here comes another fight
(Same for all verses)
 
So ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Bore me and hold me and cling to my arm
Here it comes, here it comes
 
And what you're asking me now, disastrous now
Hoping and hoping and hoping
The feeling goes away
 
Chorus:
Ab
Never change, never change, never change, never change
 
Never change, never change, never change
                    Db     Dbm (If you want)
This is why I fell in love oooh
(Same for every chorus)
 
Never change, never change, never change, never change
Never change, never change, never change
That's just too up there in love with
(in loveeeee ...)
 
This is the time the very best time
So give me a line and take me hoooome
Take me oveeeer
 
But dashing the hopes dashing the hopes
And smashing the pride
The morning's got you on the ropes .. ooh
 
And love is a murderer , love is a murderer
But if she calls you tonight
Everything is all right
Yeah, we knoooooow
And love is a curse shoved in a hearse
Love is an open book to a verse of your bad poetry
And this is coming from me
 
But I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(fall in looove)
(repeat)
 
Turn on the light make it easy for me
Fill the divide fumble in the kitchen
'til it's right
What an awful sight
 
But there's love in your eyes
Love in your eyes , love in your eyes
But maybe that's your love of fights
All niiiiiight!
 
And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(in looove)
 
And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(in looove)
 
And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you feel real love
(real looove)
 
And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(in looove)
(repeat)
