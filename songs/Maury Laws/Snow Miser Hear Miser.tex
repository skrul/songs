He's Mister White Christmas
He's Mister Snow
He's Mister Icicle
He's Mister Ten Below
 
Friends call me Snow Miser,
What ever I touch
Turns to snow in my clutch
He's too much!
 
I never want to know a day
That's over forty degrees
I'd rather have it thirty,
Twenty, then Five, then let it freeze!
 
He's Mister White Christmas
He's Mister Snow
He's Mister Icicle
He's Mister Ten Below
 
Friends call me Snow Miser,
What ever I touch
Turns to snow in my clutch,
Too much!
Too Much! 

G          C
I'm Mister Green Christmas
G          Em
I'm Mister Sun
G          E7
I'm Mister Heat Blister
A7         D7
I'm Mister Hundred and One
 
B7           Em
They call me Heat Miser,
B7           Em
What ever I touch
Em        G          A7
Starts to melt in my clutch
A7      G
I'm too much!
 
G           C
He's Mister Green Christmas
G           Em
He's Mister Sun
G           E7
He's Mister Heat Blister
A7          D7
He's Mister Hundred and One
 
B7           Em
They call me Heat Miser,
B7           Em
What ever I touch
Em        G          A7
Starts to melt in my clutch
A7       G
He's too much!
 
C7
I never want to know a day
       G
That's under sixty degrees
    C7
I'd rather have it eighty,
        A7              D7
Ninety, one hundred's a breeze!
 
G           C
He's Mister Green Christmas
G           Em
He's Mister Sun
G           E7
He's Mister Heat Blister
A7          D7
He's Mister Hundred and One
 
B7           Em
They call me Heat Miser,
B7          Em
What ever I touch
Em        G          A7
Starts to melt in my clutch
D7      G
I'm too much!
D7  G
Too Much!
