\begin{verse}
^{E*} She'd been drinkin' too much ^{B}eggnog,
^{B} and we'd begged her not to ^{E}go \\
^{E7} But she forgot her medic^{A}ation,
and she ^{B}staggered out the door into the ^{E}snow \\
^{C#m} When we found her Christmas m^{G#m}ornining,
^{B7} at the scene of the a^{E}ttack  \\
^{E7} She had hoof prints on her ^{A}forehead,
and in^{B}criminating Claus marks on her ^{E*}back ^{E walk up}

 ^{C#m}  It's not Christmas without G^{G#m}randma,
^{B7} all the family’s dressed in ^{E}black \\
^{E7} And we just can't help but w^{A}onder,

^{C#m}   I've warned all my friends and ^{G#m}neighbors,
^{B7}  better watch out for your^{E}selves! \\

to a ^{B}man who ^{-}drives a ^{B*}sleigh and plays with elves! ^{E walk up}
