\begin{verse}
^{F}If you leave, ^{Dm}don't leave now,
^{Bb}please don't take my ^{C}heart away \\
^{F}Promise me just ^{Dm}one more night,
^{Am} then we'll go our ^{Bb}separate ways \\
With ^{F}hours left time ^{Dm}on our sides,
^{Bb}now it's fading ^{C}fast \\
^{F} Every second ^{Dm} every moment,
we've ^{Bb}got to--we've gotta ^{C}make it last
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
I ^{D}touch you once I ^{D/G}touch you twice,
I ^{A}won't let go at ^{G}any price \\
I ^{D}need you now like I ^{D/G}needed you then,
you ^{A}always said we'd ^{G}still be friends some ^{D}day. ^{G}
\end{chorus} 

\begin{verse}
^{G}If you leave ^{Em}I won't cry,
^{C}I won't waste one ^{D}single day \\
But ^{G}if you leave ^{Em}don't look back,
^{Bm} I'll be running the ^{C}other way \\
^{G}Seven years went ^{Em}under the bridge,
like ^{C}time was standing ^{D}still \\
^{G} Heaven knows what ^{Em}happens now,
you've ^{C}got to--you've gotta ^{D}say you will
\end{verse} 

\begin{chorus}
^{E}I touch you once I ^{E/A}touch you twice,
^{B}I won't let go at ^{A}any price \\

you ^{B}always said we'd ^{A}meet a-gain
