\begin{verse}
^{F}If you leave, ^{Dm}don't leave now,
^{Bb}please don't take my ^{C}heart away \\
^{F}Promise me just ^{Dm}one more night,
^{Am}then we'll go our ^{Bb}separate ways \\
^{F}With hours left time ^{Dm}on our sides,
^{Bb}now it's fading ^{C}fast \\
^{F}Every second ^{Dm}every moment,
^{Bb}we've got to--we've gotta ^{C}make it last
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
I ^{D}touch you once I ^{Bm}touch you twice,
I ^{A}won't let go at ^{G}any price ^{A} \\
I ^{D}need you now like I ^{Bm}needed you then,
you ^{A}always said we'd ^{G}still be ^{A}friends some ^{D}day. ^{G}
\end{chorus} 

\begin{verse}
^{G}If you leave ^{Em}I won't cry,
^{C}I won't waste one ^{D}single day \\
^{G}But if you leave ^{Em}don't look back,
^{Bm}I'll be running the ^{C}other way \\
^{G}Seven years went ^{Em}under the bridge,
^{C}like time was standing ^{D}still \\
^{G}Heaven knows what ^{Em}happens now,
^{C}you've got to--you've gotta ^{D}say you will
\end{verse}
