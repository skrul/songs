\begin{verse}
"Show me, show me, ^{A}show me how you ^{E}do that trick,
the ^{Bm}one that makes me ^{D}scream" she said \\
"The ^{A}one that makes me ^{E}laugh" she said,
and ^{Bm}threw her arms a^{D}round my neck \\
"^{A}Show me how you ^{E}do it,
and I ^{Bm}promise you, I ^{D}promise that \\
I'll run a^{A}way with you,   ^{E}
I'll run a^{Bm}way with you"  ^{D}

\begin{verse}
^{A}Spinning on that ^{E}dizzy edge,
I ^{Bm}kissed her face and ^{D}kissed her head \\
And ^{A}dreamed of all the ^{E}different ways
I ^{Bm}had to make her ^{D}glow \\
"^{A}Why are you so ^{E}far away?" she s^{Bm}aid
"Why won't you ^{D}ever know that \\
I'm in ^{A}love with you, ^{E}
that I'm in ^{Bm}love with you" ^{D}
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{F#m}You \hspace{20pt}
^{G}Soft and only \\
^{F#m}You \hspace{20pt}
^{G}Lost and lonely \\
^{F#m}You \hspace{20pt}
^{G}Strange as angels \\
^{D}Dancing in the deepest oceans,
^{D}twisting in the water \\
You're just like a ^{A}dream,  ^{E} 
you're just like a ^{Bm}dream  ^{D}
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
^{A}Daylight licked me ^{E}into shape,
I ^{Bm}must have been a^{D}sleep for days \\
And ^{A}moving lips to ^{E}breathe her name
I ^{Bm}opened up my ^{D}eyes \\
And ^{A}found myself a^{E}lone, alone,
a^{Bm}lone above a ^{D}raging sea \\
That ^{A}stole the only ^{E}girl I loved
and ^{Bm}drowned her deep in^{D}side of me
\end{verse}

\begin{outro}
^{F#m}You \hspace{20pt}
^{G}Soft and only \\
^{F#m}You \hspace{20pt}
^{G}Lost and lonely \\
^{F#m}You \hspace{20pt}
^{G}Just like heaven ^{D*}
