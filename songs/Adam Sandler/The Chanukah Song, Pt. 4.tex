\begin{chorus}
^{A}Put on your ^{E}yarmulke, ^{D}here comes ^{E}Chanukah, it's ^{A}so much ^{E}fun-akah, to ^{D}celebrate ^{E}Chanukah
\end{chorus} 

\begin{verse}
^{A*}Chanukah ^{E*}is the ^{D*}festival of ^{E*}lights, ^{A*}Instead of one day of ^{E*}presents, we have ^{D*}eight crazy ^{E*}nights \\
When you feel like the only ^{E*}kid in town with^{D*}out a Christmas ^{E*}tree,  ^{A*}here's the 4th list of people who are ^{E*}Jewish, \\
^{D*}Just like Jesus, Olaf, Punky Brewster, Scott Rudin, and m^{E*}e!
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Joseph Gordon-Levitt enjoys eating kugel, \\
So does Stan Lee, Jake Gyllenhaal, and the two guys who founded Google \\
Adam Levine wears a Jewish star, so does Drake and Seth Rogen \\
Goldberg has a gold yarmulke to match the belt he won from Hulk Hogan \\
We got Scarlett Johansson, talk about a Kosher crush \\
And if you need a higher voice to turn you on, how about Geddy Lee from Rush?
\end{verse} 

\begin{prechorus}
We ^{D}may not have a cartoon with a reindeer that can talk \\
^{E}But we also don't have polio, thanks to Dr. Jonas Salk (Smart Jew!) ^{E9}
\end{prechorus} 

\begin{chorus}
Put on your yarmulke, it's time for Chanukah \\
Harry Potter and his magic wand-ukah, celebrate Chanukah\end{chorus} 

\begin{verse}
Jared from Subway: Goddammit, a Jew \\
But guess who's Jewish and can fix him? "Loveline"'s Dr. Drew (Get on it doc!)  \\
Princess Leia cuts the challah with Queen Elsa from "Frozen" \\
David Beckham is the king of soccer studs and also a quarter chosen \\
Ron Jeremy is fully Jewish and so is his foot-long buddy \\
Shia LaBeouf is half a Jew but a hundred percent nutty
\end{verse}
 
\begin{prechorus}
It's cool that Santa Claus makes Christmas so merry \\
But we get two jolly fat guys: ice cream's Ben \& Jerry (Both Jewish!)
\end{prechorus} 

\begin{outro}
From New York to Iran-ukah, get up and celebrate Chanukah \\
Don't mess with the Zohan-ukah, let's all get along for Chanukah \\
So drink your Jaegerbomb-ukah and smoke your medical-chron-ukah \\
If you really, really wanna-kah, have a happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy Chanukah
\end{outro}
