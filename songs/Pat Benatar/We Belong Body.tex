\begin{verse}
^{F} Many times I've tried to tell you, ^{A#}many times I've cried alone \\
^{F} Always I'm surprised how well you ^{A#}cut my feelings to the bone \\
^{Gm} Don't want to leave you really, ^{F}I've invested ^{A#}too much time \\
^{Gm} To give you up that easy, ^{C}to the doubts that complicate your ^{(F)}mind
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{F} We belong to the ^{A#}light, we belong to the ^{C}thunder \\
We be^{F}long to the sound of the ^{A#}words, we've both fallen ^{C}under \\
What^{F}ever we deny or em^{A#}brace, for worse or for ^{C}better \\
^{C7}We be^{F}long, we be^{A#}long, we belong to^{C}gether
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
^{F} Maybe its a sign of weakness, ^{A#}when I don’t know what to say \\
^{F}Maybe I just wouldn’t know, ^{A#}what to do with my strength anyway \\
^{Gm} Have we become a habit, ^{F}do we distort the ^{A#}facts \\
^{Gm} Now there’s no looking forward, ^{C}now there’s no turning back when you ^{(F)}say

\begin{verse}
^{F} Close your eyes and try to sleep now, ^{A#}close your eyes and try to dream \\
^{F} Clear your mind and do your best, to ^{A#}try and wash the palette clean \\
^{Gm} We can’t begin to know it, ^{F}how much we ^{A#}really care \\
^{Gm} I hear your voice inside me, ^{C}I see your face everywhere, still you ^{(F)}say
