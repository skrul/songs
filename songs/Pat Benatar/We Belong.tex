\begin{intro}
_{E}	
\end{intro}

\begin{verse}
^{E} Many times I've tried to tell you, ^{A}many times I've cried alone \\
^{E} Always I'm surprised how well you ^{A}cut my feelings to the bone \\
^{F#m} Don't want to leave you really, ^{E}I've invested ^{A}too much time \\
^{F#m} To give you up that easy, ^{B}to the doubts that complicate your ^{(E)}mind
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{E} We belong to the ^{A}light, we belong to the ^{B}thunder \\
We be^{E}long to the sound of the ^{A}words, we've both fallen ^{B}under \\
What^{E}ever we deny or em^{A}brace, for worse or for ^{B}better \\
^{B7}We be^{E}long, we be^{A}long, we belong to^{B}gether
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
^{E} Maybe its a sign of weakness, ^{A}when I don’t know what to say \\
^{E}Maybe I just wouldn’t know, ^{A}what to do with my strength anyway \\
^{F#m} Have we become a habit, ^{E}do we distort the ^{A}facts \\
^{F#m} Now there’s no looking forward, ^{B}now there’s no turning back when you ^{(E)}say

\end{interlude}

\begin{verse}
^{E} Close your eyes and try to sleep now, ^{A}close your eyes and try to dream \\
^{E} Clear your mind and do your best, to ^{A}try and wash the palette clean \\
^{F#m} We can’t begin to know it, ^{E}how much we ^{A}really care \\
^{F#m} I hear your voice inside me, ^{B}I see your face everywhere, still you ^{(E)}say
