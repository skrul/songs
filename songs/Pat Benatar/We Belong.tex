\begin{verse}
^{E} Many times I've tried to tell you, ^{A}many times I've cried alone \\
^{E} Always I'm surprised how well you ^{A}cut my feelings to the bone \\
^{F#m} Don't want to leave you really, ^{E}I've invested ^{A}too much time \\
^{F#m} To give you up that easy, ^{B}to the doubts that complicate your ^{E}mind
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{E}We belong to the ^{A}light, we belong to the ^{B}thunder \\
We ^{E}belong to the sound of the ^{A}words, we've both fallen ^{B}under \\
^{E}Whatever we deny or ^{A}embrace, for worse or for ^{B}better \\
^{B7} We be^{E}long, we ^{A}belong, we belong ^{B}together
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
^{E}Maybe its a sign of weakness, ^{A}when I don’t know what to say \\
^{E}Maybe I just wouldn’t know, ^{A}what to do with my strength anyway \\
^{F#m}Have we become a habit, ^{E}do we distort the ^{A}acts \\
^{F#m}Now there’s no looking forward, ^{B}now there’s no turning back when you ^{E}say
\end{verse}

\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
^{E}Close your eyes and try to sleep now, ^{A}close your eyes and try to dream \\
^{E}Clear your mind and do your best, ^{A}to try and wash the palette clean \\
^{F#m}We can’t begin to know it, ^{E}how much we really ^{A}care \\
^{F#m}I hear your voice inside me, ^{B}I see your face everywhere, still you ^{E}say
