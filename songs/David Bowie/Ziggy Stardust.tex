\begin{verse}
^{G}Now Ziggy played guitar,
^{Bm}  Jamming good with Weird and ^{C}Gilly, \\
And the Spi^-{C†} - ^{B†}ders ^{C†} ^{C#†}from ^{D}Mars.
He played it left hand,^{G} \\
But made it too far.^{Em}
Became the ^{Am}special man, \\
Then we were ^{C}Ziggy's band.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
^{G}Ziggy really sang,
^{Bm}screwed up eyes and screwed down ^{C}hairdo,
like some cat ^{B}from ^{C}Ja^{D}pan.
He could lick 'em by smili^{G}ng,
he could leave them to ^{Em}hang.
They came on so ^{A}loaded, man,
well hung, ^{C}snow white tan....
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{Am} So w^{G5}here were the sp^{F5}iders, ^{G5} ^{Am}
While the ^{G5}fly tried to break^{F5} our balls? ^{G5} ^{Am}
Just the beer ^{G5} light to gu^{F5}ide us,
so ^{G5}we ^{D}bitched about his ^{Dsus2}fans
^{D}and should we ^{E}crush his sweet hands?
\end{chorus}

\begin{interlude}
| G     D     | Cadd9 G/B G/A | x2
\end{interlude}

\begin{verse}
^{G}Ziggy played for time,
^{Bm}Jiving us that we were voo^{C}doo.
The kids ^{B}were ^{C}just ^{D}crass,
He was the ^{G}nazz,
With God given ^{Em}ass.
He took it ^{A}all too far,
But, boy, Could he ^{C}play guitar!
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{Am}Making ^{G5}love with his ^{F5}ego, ^{G5} ^{Am}
Ziggy ^{G5}sucked up in^{F5}to his mind, ^{G5} ^{Am}
Like a ^{G5}leper Mess^{F5}iah,
When ^{G5}the ^{D}kids had killed th^{Dsus2}e man
^{D}I had to ^{E}break up the band!
\end{chorus}

\begin{interlude}
| G     D     | Cadd9 G/B G/A | x2
\end{interlude}

\begin{outro}
^{G}Yeah... ^{D}      ^{Cadd9}     ^{G/B}    ^{G/A}ooo.^{G}...
^{D}        ^{Cadd9}    ZIGGY PLAYED GUIT^{G}AR!
