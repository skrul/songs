^{F#} We both lie silently still, in the ^{Badd9}dead of the night \\
Although we ^{F#}both lie close together, we feel ^{Badd9}miles apart inside \\
Was it ^{.F#}something I said, or ^{.Badd9}something I did, did my ^{.F#}words not come out ^{.Badd9}right? \\
Though I ^{C#}tried not to hurt you, though I ^{B}tried, but I guess that's why they say

^{F#}Every rose has its ^{Badd9}thorn \\
Just like ^{F#}every night has its ^{Badd9}dawn \\

^{F#}Every rose has its ^{B*}thorn

I ^{F#}listen to our favorite song, playing on the ^{Badd9}radio \\
Hear the ^{F#}DJ say love's a game of easy come and ^{Badd9}  easy go \\
But I ^{.F#}wonder, does he ^{.Badd9}know, has he ^{.F#}ever felt like ^{.Badd9}this? \\
And I ^{C#}know that you'd be here right now if I ^{B}  coulda let you know, somehow I guess

I ^{F#}know I coulda saved our love that night if I'd  ^{Badd9}  known what to say \\
^{F#} Instead of making love, we both  ^{Badd9} made our separate ways \\
And now I ^{.F#} hear you've found ^{.Badd9}somebody new, and ^{.F#}that I never meant that ^{.Badd9}much to you \\
To ^{C#}hear that tears me up inside, and to ^{B}see you cuts me like a knife, I guess
