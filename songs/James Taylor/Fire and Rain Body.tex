Just yesterday ^{Gm}morning they let me ^{F}know you were ^{C}gone ^{Csus2} ^{C}  \\
Suzanne the ^{G}plans they made put an ^{A#}end to you \\
I ^{C}walked out this ^{Gm}morning and I ^{F}wrote down this ^{C}song ^{Csus2} ^{C} \\
I just can't re^{G}member who to ^{A#}send it to  ^{A#}   ^{F}

And I won't ^{G}make it any ^{A#}other way  ^{A#}   ^{F}

Lord knows when the ^{G}cold wind blows it'll ^{A#}turn your head around \\
Well, there's ^{C}hours of time on the ^{Gm}telephone line to ^{F}talk about things to ^{C}com ^{Csus2}e     ^{C}  \\
