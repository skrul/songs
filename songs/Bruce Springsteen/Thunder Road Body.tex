\begin{verse}
The ^{F}screen door slams,^{A#} Mary's d^{F}ress waves ^{F} \\
Like a ^{F}vision she dances a^{C}cross the porch as the ^{A#}radio plays ^{A#} \\
Roy ^{A#}Orbison singing for the ^{C}lonely, hey that's ^{F}me and I want you ^{A#}only \\
Don't ^{A#}turn me home again, I ^{F}just can't face my^{C}self alone again ^{C}
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Don't ^{F}run back inside, darling ^{A#}you know just what I'm h^{F}ere for ^{F}  \\
So you're ^{F}scared and you're thinking that ^{C}maybe we ain't that ^{A#}young anymore ^{A#} \\
Show a little ^{A#}faith, there's magic in the ^{C}night, you ain't a ^{F}beauty, but hey you're al^{A#}right \\
^{A#} Oh and ^{F}that's alright with ^{C}me ^{C}
\end{verse} 

\begin{verse}
You can ^{F}hide 'neath your covers and ^{Dm}study your pain,
make ^{F}crosses from your lovers, throw ^{A#}roses in the rain \\
^{F} Waste your summer ^{Am}praying in vain
for a ^{A#}saviour to rise from these s^{C}treets \\
Well now I'm ^{F}no hero, that's under^{Dm}stood,
all the ^{F}redemption I can offer, girl, is be^{A#}neath this dirty hood \\
^{F} With a chance to make it ^{Am}good somehow,
hey ^{A#}what else can we do n^{C}ow?
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Except ^{F}roll down the window and ^{A#}let the wind blow b^{F}ack yo^{-}ur hair ^{A#*}   ^{F}  \\
Well the ^{F}night's busting open,
these ^{Am}two lanes will take us ^{A#}anywhere ^{A#} \\
We got ^{A#}one last chance to make it ^{C}real,
to ^{F}trade in these wings on some ^{A#}wheels \\
^{A#} Climb in back ^{F}heaven's waiting down ^{C}on the tracks ^{C}
\end{verse} 

\begin{verse}
^{F}Oh oh come ^{Dm}take my hand,
we're ^{F}riding out tonight to ^{A#}case the promised land \\
^{F} Oh oh oh ^{Am}oh Thunder Road,^{A#} oh Thunder Road, ^{C}oh Thunder Road, \\
^{F} Lying out there like a ^{Dm}killer in the sun,
hey ^{F}I know it's late we ^{A#}can make it if we run \\
^{F} Oh oh oh ^{Am}oh Thunder Road, sit ^{A#}tight take ^{C}hold, Thunder ^{F}Road ^{F*}

\begin{verse}
Well I  ^{A#}got this guitar and I l^{C}earned how to make it t^{F}alk ^{F} \\
And my ^{Dm}car's out back if you're ^{Dm}ready to take that ^{A#}long w^{C}alk \\
From your ^{A#}front porch to my front s^{C}eat,
the door's ^{Am}open but the ride it ain't ^{Dm}free \\
And ^{A#}I know you're lonely for words that I ^{Gm}ain't spoken,
but to^{C}night we'll be free, all the ^{C}promises'll be broken
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
There were ^{F}ghosts in the eyes of ^{A#}all the boys you s^{F}ent a^{-}way ^{A#*} ^{F}  \\
They haunt this ^{F}dusty beach road
In the ^{Am}skeleton frames of ^{A#}burned out Chevrolets ^{A#} \\
They scream your ^{A#}name at night in the ^{C}street,
your graduation ^{F}gown lies in rags at their ^{A#}feet \\
And in the ^{Am}Lonely cool before ^{Am}dawn you hear their  ^{A#}engines roaring ^{A#}on  \\
But when you ^{Gm}get to the porch they're ^{C}gone on the ^{A#}wind ^{A#}- so Mary c^{Gm}limb in ^{Gm} \\
It's a ^{A#}town full of losers and I'm p^{C}ulling out of here to w^{F}in ^{F*}
