\begin{verse}
I saw her s^{A}tandin' on her front ^{D}lawn just ^{A}twirlin' her ba^{D}ton \\
Me and ^{G}her went for a ^{D}ride sir and t^{A}en innocent people ^{D}died \\
From the ^{A}town of Lincoln Neb^{D}raska with a sawed-off .4^{A}10 on my ^{D}lap \\
Through to the ^{G}badlands of Wy^{D}oming I killed ^{A}everything in my ^{D}path

\begin{verse}
I can't ^{A}say that I'm so^{D}rry for the th^{A}ings that we d^{D}one \\
At least ^{G}for a little whi^{D}le sir me and ^{A}her we had us some ^{D}fun \\
Now the ^{A}jury brought in a guilty ^{D}verdict and the ^{A}judge he sentenced me to ^{D}death \\
Mid^{G}night in a prison ^{D}storeroom, leather ^{A}straps across my ^{D}chest \\ 
Sheriff when the ^{A}man pulls that ^{D}switch sir and ^{A}snaps my poor head ^{D}back \\
You make ^{G}sure my pretty ^{D}baby is sittin' ^{A}right there on my ^{D}lap

\begin{verse}
They de^{A}clared me unfit t^{D}o live said into that ^{A}great void my soul be hur^{D}led \\
They wanted to ^{G}know why I did what I ^{D}did, well sir I guess there's just a ^{A}meanness in this ^{D}world
