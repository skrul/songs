\begin{verse}
^{A}As I was motivatin' over the hill, I saw Maybellene in a Coupe de Ville \\
^{A}Cadillac rollin' on the open road, nothin' outruns my V-8 Ford \\
^{A}Cadillac doin' 'bout 95, bumper-to-bumper, rollin' side by side

\begin{verse}
^{A}Cadillac rolled up ahead of the Ford, the Ford got hot, wouldn't do no more \\
^{A}It soon got cloudy and it started to rain, I tooted my horn for the passing lane \\
^{A}Rain was pourin' under my hood, I knew that was doin' my motor good

\begin{verse}
^{A}Motor cooled down, the heat went down, that's when I heard that highway sound \\
^{A}The Cadillac sittin' like a ton of lead, 110 half a mile ahead \\
^{A}The Cadillac looked like it was sittin' still, I caught Maybellene at the top of the hill
