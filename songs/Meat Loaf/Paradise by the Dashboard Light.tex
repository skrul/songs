Ok, here we go, we got a real pressure cooker going here, \\
Two down, nobody on, no score, bottom of the ninth. \\
There's the wind-up and there it is, a line shot up the middle. \\
Look at him go. This boy can really fly! \\
He's rounding first and really turning it on now, \\
He's not letting up at all, he's gonna try for second; \\
The ball is bobbled out in center, \\
and here comes the throw, and what a throw! \\
He's gonna slide in head first, here he comes, he's out! \\
No, wait, safe - safe at second base, \\
This kid really makes things happen out there. \\
Batter steps up to the plate, here's the pitch - \\
And he's going, and what a jump he's got, he's trying for third, \\
here's the throw, it's in the dirt - safe at third! Holy cow, stolen base! \\
He's taking a pretty big lead out there, \\
almost daring 'em to try and pick him off. \\
The pitcher glances over, winds up, and it's bunted, \\
bunted down the third base line, the suicide squeeze is on! \\
Here he comes, squeeze play, it's gonna be close, \\
Here's the throw, here's the play at the plate, \\
Holy cow, I think he's gonna make it
