[Chorus]
C                Am  G             F
  Well there's a rose in a fisted glove
        Am         G         F
And the eagle flies with the dove
           Am       G                F
And if you can't be with the one you love, honey
                    C
Love the one you're with
                    C
Love the one you're with
                    C
Love the one you're with

Love the one you're with
 
Don't be angry, don't be sad
Don't sit crying over good times you've had
There's a girl right next to you
And she's just waiting for something to do

 
[Verse 2]
 
Turn your heartache right into joy
Cause she's a girl and you're a boy
Get it together, make it nice
You ain't gonna need anymore advice

 
[Chorus 2]
 
 
[Bridge]
 
    Am  F  Am -     Am  F  Am      -   Am F C       -   C-C-C
Du-du-du-du-dutu, Du-du-du-du-dutu, Du-du-du-du-dutu - DU-DU-DU!
