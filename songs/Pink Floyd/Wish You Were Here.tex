\begin{verse}
^{C}So, so you think you can ^{D}tell \\
Heaven from ^{Am}Hell,
blue skies from ^{G}pain \\
Can you tell a green ^{D}field
from a cold steel ^{C}rail? \\
A smile from a ^{Am}veil?
Do you think you can ^{G}tell?
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
And did they get you to ^{C}trade
your heroes for ^{D}ghosts? \\
Hot ashes for ^{Am}trees?
Hot air for a ^{G}cool breeze? \\
Cold comfort for ^{D}change?
And did you ex^{C}change \\
A walk on part in the ^{Am}war
for a lead role in a ^{G}cage?
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
^{C} How I wish, how I wish you were ^{D}here \\
We're just ^{Am}two lost souls
swimming in a fishbowl,
^{G} year after year \\
^{D} Running over the same old ground,
^{C} what have we found? \\
The same old ^{Am}fears,
wish you were ^{G}here
