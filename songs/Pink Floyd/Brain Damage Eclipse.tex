^{D} The lunatic is on the ^{G7/D}grass, ^{D} the lunatic is on the ^{G7/D}grass \\
^{D} Remembering games and ^{E/D}daisy chains and laughs \\

^{D} The lunatic is in the ^{G7/D}hall, ^{D} the lunatics are in my ^{G7/D}hall \\

^{G}  And if the dam breaks open ^{A}many years too soon \\

I'll ^{C}see you on the dark side of the ^*{G}mo ^{-}on ^{Bm7}(Oh ^{Em7}oh ^{-} ^{A7}oh)

^{D} The lunatic is in my ^{G7/D}head, (laughter) ^{D} the lunatic is in my ^{G7/D}head     \\
^{D} You raise the blade, ^{E/D} you make the change \\
^{A}You ^*{-}re-a ^{A7}rrange me 'till I'm ^*{D}san ^{-}e ^{Dsus2} \\

^{D} You lock the door, and ^{E/D}throw away the key \\
There's ^*{A}someon ^{-}e in my ^{A7}head but it's not ^*{D}m e^{-} ^{Dsus2} ^{D7} ^{-} ^{D9}
\end{verse} 

\begin{chorus}
^{G}  And if the cloud bursts, ^{A}thunder in your ear \\
^{C}  You shout and no one seems to ^{G}hear \\
^{G} And if the band you're in starts ^{A7}playing different tunes \\
I'll ^{C}see you on the dark side of the ^*{G}mo ^{-}on ^{Bm7}(Oh ^{Em7}oh ^{-} ^{A7}oh)

And ^{D}all that is now, and ^{D7}all that is gone, and ^{Bb}all that's to come, and ^{A7}everything under the \\
