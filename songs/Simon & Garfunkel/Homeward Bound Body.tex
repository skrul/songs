\begin{chorus}
Homeward ^{D#}bound, I wish ^{Bb}I was, \\
Homeward ^{D#}bound, \\
^{Bb}Home where my ^{Bbsus4}thought's escaping \\
^{Bb}Home where my ^{Bbsus4}music's playing, \\
^{Bb}Home where my ^{Bbsus4}love lays waiting \\
^{F}Silently for^{Bb} me
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
^{Bb}Ev'ry day's an endless stream \\
Of ^{Bb/A}cigarettes and magaz^{Bb/Ab}ines, mm^{G}mm \\
And ^{Cm}each town looks the same to me, the ^{G#}movies and the factories \\
And ^{Bb}ev'ry stranger's face I see re^{F}minds me that I long to b^{Bb}e,

Like ^{Bb}emptiness in harmony I ^{F}need someone to comfort ^{Bb}me
