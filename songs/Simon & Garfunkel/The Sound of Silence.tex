_{D#m}
\end{intro}

\begin{verse}
Hello darkness, my old f^{C#}riend, ^{C#}
I've come to talk with you ^{D#m}again ^{D#m} \\
Because a vision softly-^{.B}y creep ^{.F#}ing, ^{F#}
left its seeds while I ^{.B}was slee^{F#}ping, \\
And the ^{B}vision that was ^{B}planted in my ^{F#}brain
still remains  ^{.F#} \hspace{10pt} ^{.D#m}    \\
^{.F#} Within the so^{C#}und of sil^{D#m}ence ^{D#m*}
\end{verse} 

\begin{verse}
In restless dreams I walked a^{C#}lone, ^{C#}
narrow streets of cobble^{D#m}stone, ^{.D#m} \\
'neath the halo of ^{.B}a street ^{.F#}lamp,  ^{F#}
I turned my collar to the ^{.B}cold and ^{F#}damp \\
When my ^{B}eyes were stabbed by the ^{B}flash of a neon ^{F#}light,
That split the night^{.F#} \hspace{10pt} ^{.D#m} \\
^{F#} And touched the s^{C#}ound of si^{D#m}lence ^{D#m*}
\end{verse} 

\begin{verse}
And in the naked light I ^{C#}saw ^{C#}
ten thousand people, maybe ^{D#m}more ^{D#m} \\
People talking with^{.B}out spea^{.F#}king, ^{F#}
people hearing with^{.B}out liste^{F#}ning, \\
People writing ^{B}songs that ^{B}voices never ^{F#}share,
and no one dar^{.F#}e \hspace{10pt} ^{.D#m}    \\
^{F#} Disturb the s^{C#}ound of si^{D#m}lence ^{D#m*}
\end{verse} 

\begin{verse}
Fools said I, you do not ^{C#}know, ^{C#}
silence like a cancer ^{D#m}grows ^{D#m} \\
Hear my words that I ^{.B}might teach ^{.F#}you, ^{F#}
Take my arms that I ^{.B}might reach ^{F#}you. \\
But my ^{B}words like ^{B}silent raindrops ^{F#}fell, ^{.F#} \hspace{10pt} ^{.D#m} \\
And^{F#} echoed
In the ^{C#}wells of s^{D#m}ilence ^{D#m*}
\end{verse}
 
\begin{verse}
And the people bowed and ^{C#}prayed, ^{C#}
to the neon God they ^{D#m}made ^{D#m} \\
And the sign flashed out ^{.B}its war^{.F#}ning, ^{F#}
in the words that it w^{.B}as for^{F#}ming. \\
And the sign said, the ^{B}words of the prophets
are ^{B}written on the subway w^{F#}alls, and tenement ^{.F#}halls \hspace{10pt} ^{.D#m} \\
And whisp^{F#}er'd in the s^{C#}ounds of si^{D#m}lence. \\
\end{verse}
