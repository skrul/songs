\begin{verse}
^{D}I took off for a w^{G}eekend last month,
just to ^{A}try and recall the whole ^{D}year \\
^{D}All of the faces and ^{G}all of the places,
w^{A}onderin' where they all disa^{D}ppeared \\
^{Bm}I didn't ponder the ^{F#m}question too long,
I was ^{G}hungry and went out for a ^{A}bite \\
Ran ^{G}into a chum with a ^{D}bottle of rum,
and we ^{A}wound up drinkin' all ^{D}night
\end{verse} 
 
\begin{chorus}
It's those ^{G}changes in latitudes, ^{D}changes in attitudes \\
^{A}Nothing remains quite the ^{D}same \\
With ^{G}all of our running and a^{D}ll of our cunning \\
If ^{A}we couldn't laugh we would a^{G\dag}ll go in^{D}sane ^{D}
\end{chorus} 
 
\begin{verse}
^{D}Reading departure signs ^{G}in some big airport,
rem^{A}inds me of the places I've b^{D}een \\
^{D}Visions of good times that br^{G}ought so much pleasure,
makes ^{A}me want to go back ag^{D}ain \\
If it su^{Bm}ddenly ended tom^{F#m}orrow,
I could so^{G}mehow adjust to the f^{A}all \\
^{G}Good times and riches and s^{D}on of a bitches,
I've s^{A}een more than I can rec^{D}all
\end{verse} 

\begin{chorus}
It's those ^{G}changes in latitudes, ^{D}changes in attitudes \\
^{A}Nothing remains quite the ^{D}same \\
Through ^{G}all of the islands and ^{D}all of the highlands \\
If ^{A}we couldn't laugh we would a^{G\dag}ll go in^{D}sane ^{D}
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
I t^{D}hink about Paris when I'm h^{G}igh on red wine,
I w^{A}ish I could jump on a pl^{D}ane \\
^{D}So many nights I just dr^{G}eam of the ocean,
God, I w^{A}ish I was sailin' ag^{D}ain \\
Oh, y^{Bm}esterday's over my sh^{F#m}oulder,
so ^{G}I can't look back for too l^{A}ong \\
There's just t^{G}oo much to see waiting ^{D}in front of me,
and I k^{A}now that I just can't go wr^{D}ong
\end{verse} 
 
\begin{chorus}
With these ^{G}changes in latitudes, ^{D}changes in attitudes \\
^{A}Nothing remains quite the ^{D}same \\
With ^{G}all of our running and a^{D}ll of my cunning \\
If ^{A}I couldn't laugh, I just ^{G\dag}would go in^{.D}sane \\
If ^{A}we couldn't laugh, we just ^{G\dag}would go in^{.D}sane \\
If ^{A}we weren't all crazy we ^{G}would ^{A}go in^{G}sane ^{D}  ^{A} ^{G\dag}  ^{D*}
