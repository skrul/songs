\begin{verse}
^{D} Nibblin' on sponge cake, ^{D} watchin' the sun bake \\
^{D} All of those tourists covered with ^{A}oil  \\
^{A} Strummin' my six string, ^{A} on my front porch swing \\
^{A} Smell those shrimp they're beginnin' to ^{D} b^{-}oil ^{D7}

\begin{chorus}
^{G} Wastin' a^{A}way again in Marga^{D}ritaville, ^{D7} \hspace{20pt} ^{G} searchin' for m^{A}y lost shaker of ^{D}salt ^{D7} \\
^{G} Some people ^{A}claim that there's a ^*{D -}wo ^{A/C#}man to b^{G}lame, but I ^{A}know, ^{A} it's nobody's ^{D}fault ^{D}
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
^{D} Don't know the reason, ^{D} I stayed here all season \\

^{G} Wastin' a^{A}way again in Marga^{D}ritaville, ^{D7} \hspace{20pt}  ^{G} searchin' for m^{A}y lost shaker of ^{D}salt ^{D7} \\

^{D} I blew out my flip flop, ^{D} stepped on a pop top \\

^{A} That frozen concoction that helps me hang ^*{D}on ^{-} ^{D7}
