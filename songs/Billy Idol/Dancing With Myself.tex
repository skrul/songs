_{E}

\begin{verse}
On the ^{E}floors of Tokyo-o, or down in ^{A}London town to go, go \\
A-with the ^{B}record selection and the mirror's reflection I'm-a ^{A}dancing with myself \\
Oh when there's ^{E}no-one else in sight, a-in the ^{A}crowded lonely night \\
Well, I ^{B}wait so long for my love vibration and I'm ^{A}dancing with myself
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus1}
Oh, oh, ^{E}dancing with myself, oh, oh, ^{A}dancing with myself \\
When there's ^{B}nothing to lose and there's nothing to prove \\
And I'm ^{A}dancing with myself, oh oh, uh-oh ^{E}
\end{chorus1}

\begin{verse}
If I ^{E}looked all over the world, and there's ^{A}every type of girl \\
But your ^{B}empty eyes seem to pass me by, leave me ^{A}dancing with myself \\
So let's ^{E}sink another drink, 'cause it'll ^{A}give me time to think \\
If I had the ^{B}chance I'd ask the world to dance, and I'll be ^{A}dancing with myself
