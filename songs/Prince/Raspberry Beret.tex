[Intro]
| A G | D/F# | G | D G A |
 
 
[Verse 1]
      A            G         D/F#
I was working part time in a five-and-dime,
   G                   D G A
My boss was Mr. McGee.
                   G             D/F#
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind,
       G                        D G A
'Cause I was a bit 2 leisurely.
                 G          D/F#
Seems that I was busy doing something close 2 nothing,
    G                               D G A
But different than the day before.
              G        D/F#
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
           G
She walked in through the out door (out door).
 
 
[Chorus]
           A   G           D/F#
She wore a Raspberry beret
    G                  D    G    A
The kind U find in a second hand store
    G           D/F#
Raspberry beret
    G                                D    A
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
    G           D/F#
Raspberry beret
          E    A
I think I love her
 
 
[Verse 2]
A              G                    D/F#
Built like she was, uh, she had the nerve 2 ask me
     G                          D G A
If I planned 2 do her any harm
                                     G                D/F#
So, look here, I put her on the back of my bike and-a we went riding
G                               D G A
Down by old man Johnson's farm
                     G          D/F#
I said now, overcast days never turned me on
    G                                         D G A
But something about the clouds and her mixed
           G            D/F#
She wasn't 2 bright but I could tell
                G
When she kissed me
 
She knew how 2 get her kicks
 
 
[Chorus]
           A   G           D/F#
She wore a Raspberry beret
    G                  D    G    A
The kind U find in a second hand store
    G           D/F#
Raspberry beret
    G                                D    A
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
    G           D/F#
Raspberry beret
          E    A
I think I love her
 
 
[Verse 3]
D        A/C#           D       A/C#
The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof,
NC
And the horses wonder who U are.
D       A/C#                D              A/C#
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
  NC
U feel like a movie star
        G        F#m            E
Listen, they say the first time ain't the greatest
               NC
But I tell ya, if I had the chance 2 do it all again
  G                               F#m
I wouldn't change a stroke 'cause baby I'm the most,
       E
With a girl as fine as she was then.
