I was ^{A}working part ^{G}time in a ^{D/F#}five-and-dime, my ^{G}boss was Mr. McGee \riff  \\
He ^{A}told me several ^{G}times that he ^{D/F#}didn't like my kind, 'cause ^{G}I was a bit to leisurely \riff   \\
^{A}Seems that I was ^{G}busy doing ^{D/F#}something close to nothing, but ^{G}different than the day before \riff  \\

She wore a ^*{A}rasp ^{G}berry beret ^{D/F#}, the ^{G}kind you find in a se^{D/F#}cond ^{G}hand ^{A}store \\
^*{A}Rasp ^{G}berry beret, ^{D/F#} and ^{G}if it was warm she wouldn't ^{G}wear ^{D/F#}much ^{A}more \\
^*{A}Rasp ^{G}berry beret ^{D/F#} \\

^{D} The rain ^{A/C#}sounds so cool ^{D}when it hits the  ^{A/C#}barn roof ^{D} and the horses ^{A/C#}wonder who you are ^{D} ^{A/C#} \\
^{D} Thunder drowns ^{A/C#}out what the lightning ^{D}sees, ^{A/C#} you ^{D}feeeeeel ^{A/C#}like a movie star ^{D}  ^{A/C#} \\
Listen, ^{G}they say ^{D/F#}the first time ^{E}ain't the greatest \\

With a ^{E}girl as fine as she was then. \\
