^{Bbm} As I walk along, I ^{G#}wonder what went wrong \\
With ^{F#}our love, a love that was so ^{F7}strong \\
^{Bbm} And as I still walk on, I ^{G#}think of, the things we`ve done \\
To^{F#}gether, while our hearts were ^{F7}young

\begin{chorus}
^{Bb} I`m  walking in the rain, ^{Gm} tears are falling and I feel the pain \\
^{Bb} Wishing you were here by me, ^{Gm} to end this misery \\

I ^{Bb}wonder,  I wa-wa-wa-wa-w^{Gm}onder? \\
^{Bb}Why? Wha, wha, wha, wha, w^{Gm}hy, she ran away? \\
And I ^{D#}wonder, where she will s^{F7}tay-yay \\
My little ^*{Bb}runa ^{-}way ^{D#}run, run, run, run, ^*{Bb}runa ^{-}way ^{F7}
