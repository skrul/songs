\begin{verse}
I feel ^{N.C.}tears wellin' up cold and ^{N.C.}deep inside \\
Like ^{D}my heart's sprung a big ^{A}break \\
And the ^{A}stab of loneliness ^{A}sharp and painful \\
That ^{B}I may never ^{E7}shake \\
Now, ^{A}you might say that I was t^{A}akin' it hard \\
Since you ^{D}wrote me off with a ^{A}call \\
But don't you ^{A}wager that'll hide the ^{A}sorrow \\
When I may ^{E}break right down and ^{A}bawl ^{A*}
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
Now, the race is ^{A}on and here comes ^{A}pride up the backstretch,
^{D} heartaches are ^{D}goin' to the inside \\
^{A} My tears are ^{A}holdin' back,
^{B} they're tryin' not to ^{E7}fall \\
^{A}My heart's out of the ^{A}runnin',
true love's ^{D}scratched for another's ^{A}sake \\
The race is ^{A}on and it looks like ^{A}heartaches,
and the ^{E}winner loses ^{A}all ^{A*}

\begin{verse}
One day I ^{N.C.}ventured in love never ^{N.C.}once suspectin' \\
What the ^{D}final result would ^{A}be \\
How I ^{A}lived in fear of wakin' ^{A}up each a-morning \\
And ^{B}findin' that you're gone from ^{E7}me  \\
There's ^{A}ache and pain in my ^{A}heart for the day \\
Was the ^{D}one that I hated to ^{A}face \\
Somebody ^{A}new came up to ^{A}win her \\
I came ^{E}out in second ^{A}place ^{A*}
