\begin{verse}
It's as^{A}tounding, time is f^{B}leeting ^*{G}mad ^{-}ness ^{D}   takes its ^{A}toll \\
But listen ^{A}closely, not for very much ^{B}longer  ^{G}I've g^{-}ot to ^{D} keep con^{A}trol \\
I ^{A}remember doing the ^{B}Time Warp, ^*{G}drin ^{-}king ^{D} those moments ^{A}when \\
The blackness would ^{A}hit me and the void would be ^{B}calling \\  
^{F*}Let's ^{C*}do the ^{G*}Time ^{D*}Warp a^{A}gain! \\
^{F*}Let's ^{C*}do the ^{G*}Time ^{D*}Warp a^{A}gain!
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{N.C.}It's just a jump to the left \space\space \quarterrest \space\space ^{E} and then a step to the r^{A}ight  \\
^{N.C.}With your hands on your hips ^{E} you bring your knees in ^{A}tight \\
But it's the pelvic ^{D}thrust \hspace{10pt} that really drives you in^{A}sane  \\
^{F*}Let's ^{C*}do the ^{G*}Time ^{D*}Warp a^{A}gain! \\
^{F*}Let's ^{C*}do the ^{G*}Time ^{D*}Warp a^{A}gain!
 \end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
It's so ^{A}dreamy - oh fantasy ^{B}free me! So you can't ^{G} see^{-} me ^{D} no, not at ^{A}all \\
In another ^{A}dimension, with voyeuristic inten^{B}tion,  well se^*{G}clud ^{-}ed  ^{D} I see ^{A}all \\
With a bit of a ^{A}mind flip, you're into the ^{B}time slip, and ^*{G} noth^{-}ing ^{D} can ever be the ^{A}same \\ 
You're spaced out on ^{A}sensation, like you're under se^{B}dation! \\ 
^{F*}Let's ^{C*}do the ^{G*}Time ^{D*}Warp a^{A}gain! \\
^{F*}Let's ^{C*}do the ^{G*}Time ^{D*}Warp a^{A}gain!
\end{verse} 

\begin{verse}
Well I was ^{A}walking down the street just-a having a think,
when a ^{A}snake of a guy gave me an evil wink \\
He ^{D}shook-a me up, it took me by surprise, he had a ^{A}pick-up truck and the devil's eyes \\
He ^{E}stared at ^{-}me and I ^{D}felt a change, ^{A}time meant nothing, never would again \\
^{F*}Let's ^{C*}do the ^{G*}Time ^{D*}Warp a^{A}gain! \\
^{F*}Let's ^{C*}do the ^{G*}Time ^{D*}Warp a^{A}gain!
