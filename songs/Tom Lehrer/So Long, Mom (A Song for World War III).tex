\begin{chorus}
^{F} So long, Mom, I'm ^{F7}off to drop the bomb \\
So ^{Bb}don't ^{-} wait ^{Bbm}up for ^{F}me \\
But ^{Bb}while you swelter down ^{F}there ^{-}in your ^{D7}shelter \\
^{G7*}You can see me ^{C7*}on your TV
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
While ^{F} we're attacking ^{Bbm6} frontally \\
Watch ^{F} Brinkally and ^{Bbm6} Huntally \\
^{F} Describing contra-^{Bbm6}puntally \\
The ^{Bb} cities we have ^{A} lost \\
No ^{Bb} need for you to ^{F} miss a ^{D7} minute \\
Of the ^{G7} agonizing ^{C} holo-^{F}caust, ye^{C}ah
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
^{F} Little Johnny Jones, he was a ^{C} US pilot \\
And no shrinking violet was ^{F} he ^{C} \\
^{F} He was mighty proud when World War ^{G7} Three was declared \\
He wasn't scared, no sir-^{C7}ee! \\
And this is what he said on his ^{F} way to Arma-^{G7}ged -^{C7}don
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{F} So long, Mom, I'm ^{F7} off to drop the bomb \\
So ^{Bb} don't wait ^{Bbm} up for ^{F} me \\
But ^{Bb} though I may roam I'll come ^{F} back to my ^{D7} home \\
Al-^{G7}though it may be a ^{C7} pile of debris
\end{chorus}

\begin{outro}
Re-^{F}member, ^{Bbm6} Mommy, I'm ^{F} off to get a ^{Bbm6} commie \\
So ^{F} send me a ^{Bbm6} salami, and ^{Bb}try to smile some-^{A}how \\
I'll ^{Bb} look for you when the ^{F} war is o-^{D7}ver \\
An ^{G7} hour and a ^{C} half from ^{F} now ^{C} ^{F}
\end{outro}
