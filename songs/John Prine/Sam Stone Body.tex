\begin{verse}
Sam ^{F}Stone came home, to his ^{Bb}wife and family, after ^{C}serving in the conflict over^{F}seas \\
And the ^{F}time that he served, had ^{Bb}shattered all his nerves, and ^{C}left a little shrapnel in his ^{F}knee. \\
But the ^{Bb}morphine eased the pain, and the ^{Bb}grass grew 'round his brain, \\
And ^{G7}gave him all the confidence he ^*{C}lack ^{-}ed; ^{C7} \\
With a ^{G}Purple He^{-}art and a ^{G7}monkey on his ^*{C}bac ^{-}k. ^{C7*}

\begin{chorus}
There's a ^{F}hole in daddy's arm where all the ^{Gm}money goes, \\
^{Bb} And Jesus Christ died for nothin' ^{C}I suppose. \\
Little ^{F}pitchers have big ears, don't ^{Dm}stop to count the years, \\
S^{G7}weet songs never last too long on ^{C} broken radios, Mmm hmm hmm ^{F}hmm
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
Sam ^{F}Stone's welcome home, didn't ^{Bb}last too long, ^{C} he went to work when he'd spent his last ^{F}dime \\
And ^{F}Sammy took to stealing, when he ^{Bb}got that empty feeling, for a ^{C}hundred dollar habit without over^{F}time. \\
And the ^{Bb}gold rolled through his veins, like a ^{Bb}thousand railroad trains, \\
And ^{G7}eased his mind in the hours that he ^*{C}cho ^{-}se; ^{C7} \\
While the ^{G}kids ran ^{-}around ^{G7}wearin' other peoples' ^*{C}clot ^{-}hes. ^{C7*}

\begin{verse}
Sam ^{F}Stone was alone, when he ^{Bb}popped his last balloon, ^{C} climbing walls while sitting in a ^{F}chair \\
Well, he ^{F}played his last request, while the ^{Bb}room smelled just like death, with an ^{C}overdose hovering in the ^{F}air \\
But ^{Bb}life had lost its fun, and there was ^{Bb}nothing to be done, \\
But ^{G7}trade his house that he bought on the G. I. ^*{C}Bil ^{-}l; ^{C7} \\
For a ^{G}flag draped ^{-}casket on a ^{G7}local heroes' ^*{C}hil ^{-}l. ^{C7*}
