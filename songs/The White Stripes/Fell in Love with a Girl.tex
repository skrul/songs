\begin{verse}
^{B} Fell in love with a ^{A}girl, 
I ^{D}fell in love once and al^{E}most completely \\
^{B} She's in love with the wor^{A}ld,  
but some^{D}times these feelings can be ^{E}so misleading \\
^{F#} She turns and says, "Are ^{A}you alright?" \space\space
I said, "I ^{D}must be fine 'cause my ^{E}heart's still beating" \\
^{F#} "Come and kiss me by the ^{A}riverside, yeah,
^{F#*}Bobby says it's fine he, don't ^{N.C.}consider it cheating, now"
\end{verse}  
\begin{verse}
^{B} Red hair with a c^{A}url,
Mello-^{D}Roll for the flavor, and the ^{E}eyes for peepin' \\
^{B} Can't keep away from the gi^{A}rl, \space\space
these two ^{D}sides of my brain need to ^{E}have a meeting \\
^{F#} Can't think of any^{A}thing to do, yeah,
my ^{D}left brain knows that all ^{E}love is fleeting \\
^{F#} She's just looking for ^{A}something new, yeah,
I ^{F#*}said it once before, but it ^{N.C.}bears repeating now
\end{verse} 
 
\begin{chorus}
^{B} Ah ahahah ^{A}ah ah, ^{D} ah ahahah ^{E}ah ah, \\
^{B} Ah ahahah ^{A}ah ah, ^{D} ah ahahah ^{E}ah ah, \\
^{F#} Can't think of any^{A}thing to do, yeah,
my ^{D}left brain knows that all ^{E}love is fleeting \\
^{F#} She's just looking for ^{A}something new,
well, I ^{F#*}said it once before, but it ^{N.C}bears repeating now
