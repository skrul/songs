\begin{verse}
I was ^{G}watching,
with one ^{C}eye on the other side \\
I had ^{D}fifteen people telling me to move
I got ^{G}movin’ on my mind \\
I found ^{G}shelter,
in some ^{C}thoughts turning wheels around \\
I said ^{D}thirty nine times that I love you
to the ^{G}beauty I have found.
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
Well it's, ^{G}one, two, three, four, take the elevator,
at the ^{C}Hotel Yorba I'll be glad to see you later \\
^{D} All they got inside is vacan^{G}cy ^{-} ^{F} ^{-} ^{G}
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
I've been ^{G}thinking,
of a little ^{C}place down by the lake \\
They've got a ^{D}dirty old road leading up to the house
I wonder ^{G}how long it will take \\
'Till we're ^{G}alone,
sitting on the ^{C}front porch of that home \\
^{D}Stompin’ our feet on the wooden boards,
^{G}never gotta worry about locking the door

\begin{verse}
It might sound ^{G*}silly,
for me to think ^{C*}childish thoughts like these \\
But ^{D*}I'm so tired of acting tough,
I’m gonna ^{G*}do what I please \\
Let's get ^{G}married,
in a big ca^{C}thedral by a priest \\
'Cause if ^{D}I'm the man that you love the most,
you could ^{G}say "I do" at least.
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
Well it's, ^{G}one, two, three, four, take the elevator,
at the ^{C}Hotel Yorba I'll be glad to see you later \\
^{D} All they got inside is vacan^{G}cy \\
And it's ^{G}four, five six, seven, grab your umbrella,
^{C}grab hold of me cause I’m your favorite fella \\
^{D} All they got inside is vacanc^{G}y ^{-} ^{C} ^{G} ^{-} ^{D} ^{-} ^{G*}
