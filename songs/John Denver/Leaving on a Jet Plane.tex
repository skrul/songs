All my ^{G}bags are packed, I'm ^{C}ready to go, I'm ^{G}standing here outs^{C}ide your door \\
I ^{G}hate to wake you ^{C}up to say good^{D}bye ^{D} \\

Al^{G}ready I'm so lone^{C}some I could ^{D}die ^{D}

So ^{G}kiss me and ^{C}smile for me \\

^{G}Hold me like you'll ^{C}never let me ^{D}go ^{D} \\
I'm ^{G}leaving ^{C}on a jet plane \\
^{G}   Don't know when ^{C}I'll be back again \\
^{G}  Oh b^{C}abe, I hate to ^{D}go ^{D}
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}There's so ^{G}many times I've ^{C}let you down, so ^{G}many times I've ^{C}played around \\
I ^{G}tell you now ^{C}they don't mean a ^{D}thing ^{D} \\
Every ^{G}place I go I'll ^{C}think of you, every ^{G}song I sing I'll ^{C}sing for you \\
When ^{G}I come back I'll ^{C}bring your wedding ^{D}ring ^{D}

^{G}Now the time has ^{C}come to leave you, ^{G}one more time ^{C}let me kiss you \\
Then ^{G}close your eyes ^{C}I'll be on my ^{D}way ^{D} \\
^{G}Dream about the ^{C}days to come, when ^{G}I won't have to ^{C}leave alone \\
A^{G}bout the times ^{C}I won't have to ^{D}say  ^{D}
