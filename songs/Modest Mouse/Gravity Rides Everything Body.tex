^{Aadd9}Oh, gotta see, gotta know right ^{E}now \\
What's that riding on your ^{Aadd9}everything? It isn't ^{E}anything at all. \\

^{Aadd9}Oh, gotta see, gotta know right ^{E}now. \\
What's that writing on your ^{Aadd9}shelf, in the bathrooms and the ^{E}bad motels \\

No one really cared for it at ^{Aadd9}all, not the gravity ^{E}plan. \\
^{Aadd9}Early early in the morning ^{E}it pulls all on down my sore ^{Aadd9}feet  \\
I wanna go back to ^{E}sleep.
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus} \instruction{quieter, arpeggios} \\
^{Aadd9} In the motions and the things that you say,
^{E} it all will fall, fall right into place \\
^{Aadd9} As fruit drops, flesh it sags,
^{E} everything will fall, right into place \\
^{Aadd9} When we die, some sink and some ^{E}lay,
 but at least I don't see you float away \\
^{Aadd9} And all the spilt milk, sex and weight,
^{E} it all will fall, fall right into place.
