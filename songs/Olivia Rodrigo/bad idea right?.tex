\begin{verse}
^{E}Haven't heard from you in a ^{A}couple of months,
but I'm ^{E}out right now, and I'm ^{A}all fucked up \\
And you're ^{E}callin' my phone, you're ^{A}all alone,
and ^{E}I'm sensin' some ^{A}undertone \\
And ^{E}I'm right here with ^{A}all my friends,
but you're ^{E}sendin' me your ^{A}new address \\
And I ^{E}know we're done, I ^{A}know we're through,
but, ^{E}God, when I look at ^{A}you
\end{verse} 
 
\begin{refrain}
My brain goes, "^{E}Ah ^{D}" \\
Can't hear my ^{C#m}thoughts (I cannot ^{C}hear my thoughts) \\
Like blah-blah-blah-^{E}blah (Blah-blah-blah-^{D}blah-blah-blah) \\
Should probably, ^{C#m}I should probably, probably not \\
^{C}I should probably, probably not
\end{refrain}

\begin{prechorus}
^{E}Seein' you tonight^{A}, It's a ^{E}bad idea, ^{A}right? \\

\end{prechorus} 
 
\begin{chorus}
^{E}Yes, I know that ^{A}he's my ex,
but ^{E}can't two people ^{A}reconnect? \\
I ^{E}only see him ^{A}as a friend,
(The ^{E}biggest lie I ^{A}ever said) \\
Oh, ^{E}yes, I know that ^{A}he's my ex,
but ^{E}can't two people ^{A}reconnect? \\
I ^{E}only see him ^{A}as a friend
(I just ^*{E*}tr ^{E*}ipped an^{-}d fell in^{N.C.}to his bed)
\end{chorus} 
 
\begin{verse}
Now I'm ^{E}gettin' in the car, wreckin' ^{A}all my plans,
I know I should ^{N.C.}stop, but I can't \\
And I ^{E}told my friends I ^{A}was asleep,
but I ^{E}never said where, ^{A}or in whose sheets \\
And I ^{E}pull to your place on the ^{A}second floor,
and you're ^{E}standin', smiling ^{A}at the door \\
And I'm ^{E}sure I've seen much ^{A}hotter men,
but I ^{E}really can't re^{A}member when
\end{verse}

\begin{refrain}
My brain goes, "^{E}Ah ^{D}" \\
Can't hear my ^{C#m}thoughts (I cannot ^{C}hear my thoughts) \\

Should probably, ^{C#m}I should probably, probably not \\
^{C}I should probably, probably not
