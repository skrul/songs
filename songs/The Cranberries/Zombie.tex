^{Em} Another h^{C}ead hangs lowly, ^{G}child is slowly t^{D/F#}aken \\
^{Em} And the violence ^{C}caused such silence, ^{G}who are we mista^{D/F#}ken  \\
But you ^{Em}see it's not me, it's not ^{C}my family,
in your ^{G}head, in your head, they are fig^{D/F#}hting \\
With their ^{Em}tanks and their bombs and their ^{C}bombs and their guns,
in your h^{G}ead, in your head, they are cr^{D/F#}ying
