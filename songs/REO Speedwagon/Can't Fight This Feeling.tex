\begin{verse}
A                  E           F#m
I can't fight this feeling any longer
    D             A                E
And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow
     A              E                     F#
What started out as friendship, has grown stronger
       Bm7            D                  E
I only wish I had the strength to let it show
 
A                    E              F#m
I tell myself that I can't hold out forever
  D               A             E
I say there is no reason for my fear
        A       E                F#
Cause I feel so secure when were together
Bm7                A
You give my life direction
         D             E
You make everything so clear

\end{verse} 
 
\begin{bridge}
D
And even as I wander
    C#m
I'm keeping you in sight
         D
You're a candle in the window
     A                  E
On a cold, dark winters night
    D                       F#m              E
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

\end{bridge} 
 
\begin{bridge}
    D                  A          Bm7 D
And I can't fight this feeling anymore
                       A               Bm7  D
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
                        A             Bm7  D
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
    D                    E
And throw away the oars, forever
      D                  A          Bm7 D
Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
                        A              Bm7 D
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
                 A               Bm7
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
     C#m                   D
Come crashing through your door
      D                  E           A
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

\begin{verse}
A                       E                 F#m
My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you
           D                A             E
I've been running round in circles in my mind
        A                     E        F#
And it always seems that I'm following you, girl
          Bm7            A/C#         D              E
Cause you take me to the places that alone I'd never find
