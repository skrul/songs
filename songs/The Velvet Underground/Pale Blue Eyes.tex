Linger ^{C}on, your pale blue ^{F}eyes \\
Linger ^{C}on, your pale blue ^{F}eyes
\end{verse}

^{Gm}I've had but ^{Bb}couldn't ^{F}keep \\
^{Bb}I've had but ^{C}couldn't ^{F}keep \\
Linger ^{C}on, your pale blue ^{F}eyes \\
Linger ^{C}on, your pale blue ^{F}eyes \\

^{F}It was good what we did yesterday \\
^{Bb}And I'd do it once a^{F}gain \\
The fact that you are ^{Dm}married \\

Linger ^{C}on, your pale blue ^{F}eyes \\
