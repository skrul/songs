\begin{verse}
^{Emaj7}Mother, mother, there's too many ^{C#m}of you crying \\
^{Emaj7}Brother, brother, brother, there's far too many ^{C#m}of you dying \\
^{F#m}You know we've got to find a way \\
To bring some ^{B7}lovin' here today, hey
\end{verse}
 
\begin{verse}
^{Emaj7}Father, father, we don't need to ^{C#m}escalate \\
^{Emaj7}You see, war is not the answer, for only ^{C#m}love can conquer hate \\
^{F#m}You know we've got to find a way \\
To bring some ^{B7}lovin' here today
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{F#m}Picket lines and picket ^{B7}signs \\
^{F#m}Don't punish me with ^{B7}brutality \\
T^{F#m}alk to me, so ^{B7}you can see \\
Oh what's ^{Emaj7}going on, what's ^{C#m}going \\
Yeah, what's^{Emaj7} going on, ah, what's ^{C#m}going on \\
^{Cmaj7}Ahhh....  ^{B7}
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
^{Emaj7}Mother, mother, everybody thinks ^{C#m}we're wrong \\
^{Emaj7}Oh, but who are they to judge us. Simply 'cos our ^{C#m}hair is long \\
^{F#m}On, you know we've got to find a way \\
To bring some ^{B7}lovin' here today
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus} 
^{F#m}Picket lines and picket ^{B7}signs \\
^{F#m}Don't punish me with ^{B7}brutality \\
T^{F#m}alk to me, so ^{B7}you can see \\
Oh what's ^{Emaj7}going on, what's ^{C#m}going \\
