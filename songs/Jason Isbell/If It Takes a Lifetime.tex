\begin{verse}
I been ^{A}working here, \bb Monday, it'll be a ^{E7}year, \bb
and I ^{A}can't recall a ^*{A/C#}day when I didn't wanna disa^{D}ppear \\
But I keep on sho^{A}wing up, \bb hell-bent on gro^{E7}wing up, \bb
if it takes a lif^{D}etime \xtag
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
I'm learning how to ^{A}be alone, \bb fall asleep with the ^{E7}TV on, \bb
and I fi^{A}ght the urge to ^*{A/C#}live inside my tele^{D}phone \\
I keep my spi^{A}rits high, \bb find happiness ^{E7}by and by, \bb
if it takes a ^{D}lifetime \xtag
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
I got ^{D}too far from my raisin', I for^{A}got where I come from \\
And the ^{A}line between right and wrong was ^{E7}so fine \\
Well I ^{A}thought the highway ^{A/C#}loved mebut she ^{D}beat me like a dr^{A}um \\
My ^{A}day will come, ^*{E7}if it takes a ^{D}lifetime ^{A}
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
I don't keep liq^{A}uor here, \bb never cared for w^{E7}ine or beer \bb
and wor^{A}king for the ^{A/C#}county keeps me pis^{D}sin' clear \\
The nights are ^{A}dry as dust, \bb but I'm letting my ^{E7}eyes adjust \bb
if it takes a ^{D}lifetime \xtag

\begin{verse}
Man is a pro^{A}duct of \bb all the people that he e^{E7}ver loved \bb
And it ^{A}don't make a ^{A/B}difference ^{A/C#}how it en^{D}ded up \\
If I loved you ^{A}once my friend, \bb oh, I can do it ^{E7}all again \bb
if it takes a ^{D}lifetime \xtag 
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
We got t^{D}oo far from our raisin' and we fou^{A}ght 'til we went numb \\
You were run^{A}ning up a mountain in your ^{E7}own mind \\
And I ^{A}thought that I was ^{A/C#}running to,
but ^{D}I was running fr^{A}om \\
Oh, our ^{A}day will come, ^{E7}if it takes a ^{D}lifetime ^{A} \\
Our ^{A}day will come, ^{E7}if it takes a ^{D}lifetime ^{D} ^{D}
