\begin{verse}
We've ^{G†}come to replace your clock's ^{G}old stubborn hands \\
We are the ^{E7}answer to why they ^{E7}never had a chance \\
It was ^{G†}not so long ago that the ^{G}world was mostly slow \\
The age of ^{E7}iron, steam and speed, turned a ^{E7}stroll to a stampede
\end{verse} 

\begin{prechorus}
But we've ^{C}come to i^{-}ncrease ^{E}time in between ^{G}ticks. and there is ^{C}romance ^{-}in the ^{A}slow dances \\
'Cause they're ^{E7}fertile in hush, ^{E7}futile in haste, ^{E7}these are your nerves, ^{E7}this is how they taste
\end{prechorus} 

\begin{chorus}
Well I can't ^{D}count how many times I've been ou^{C}tdone by nihilism \\
^{G}Joined the march that splits an open ^{D}heart into a schism \\
And I ^{D}cower at the thought of other ^{C}people's expectations \\
And yet ^{G}still, hand over ^{D}mine to them
\end{chorus} 

\begin{interlude}
\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}lll}

\end{interlude}

\begin{verse}
^{G†}Travel where you are, ^{G}tourism is sin \\
These are the ^{E7}ruins we left behind, you can't ^{E7}take pictures of them \\
If ^{G†}what they say is true, then you ^{G}become what you chew \\
If it de^{E7}cays spit it out, affec^{E7}tation is a drought
\end{verse} 
 
\begin{prechorus}
That you ^{C}wait throug^{-}h when you ^{E}hate everything that you ^{G}do, you wanna ^{C}live outs^{-}ide the ^{A}groove, then fine \\
But it's ^{E7}there like a flower, ^{E7}blooming in your ears, ^{E7}open up your mouth, ^{E7}pollinate your peers
\end{prechorus} 
 
\begin{chorus}
Nothing re^{D}minds the mind of power like the ^{C}cheap odor of plastic \\
^{G}Leaking fumes we crave, consume, the ^{D}rush it feels fantastic \\
But like ^{D}power turns to mold, like a ^{C}junkie going cold \\
I need the ^{G}fix, of a little ^{D}tenderness
\end{chorus}
