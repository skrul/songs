\begin{chorus}
Say ^{A#}hey, I'll be gone today, but ^{A#}I'll be back around the way \\
^{D#}Seems like everywhere I go, the ^{A#}more I see the less I know, \\
But ^{F}I kn^{-}ow ^{D#}one thing, that I ^{A#}love you (baby girl!) \\
I ^{F}love y^{-}ou, I ^{D#}love you, I ^{A#}love you
\end{chorus} 
 
\begin{verse}
^{A#}I've been a lot of places all around the way,
^{A#}I've seen a lot of joy, and I've seen a lot of pain \\
But I don't ^{D#}want to write a love song for the world,
I just ^{A#}want to write a song about a boy and a girl \\
\\
^{A#}Junkies on the corner, always calling my name,
and the ^{A#}kids on the corner playing ghetto games \\
When I ^{D#}saw you getting down, girl, I hoped it was you,
and when I ^{A#}looked into your eyes, I knew it was true
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Now ^{A#}I'm not a highly metaphysical man,
But I ^{A#}know when the stars are aligned you can \\
^{D#}Bump into a person in the middle of the road,
^{A#}Look into their eyes, and you suddenly know \\
\\
^{F}Rocking in the dance hall, moving with you,
^{A#}Dancing in the night in the middle of June \\
^{D#}My momma told me don't lose you,
^{A#}'Cause the best luck I had was you

I say, h^{A#}ey pappa, hey pappa, got to choose \\
^{Gm}Rocking in the dance hall, moving with you,
I say, ^{A#}hey momma, hey momma, close to you \\
^{Gm}Rocking in the dance hall, moving with you,
I say, ^{F}hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma \\
