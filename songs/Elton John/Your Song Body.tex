^{D#} It's a little bit f^{G#maj7}unny,   ^{A#/D}this feeling in^{Gm}side \\
^{Cm} I'm not one of ^{Cm/A#}those who ca^{Cm/A}n easily ^{G#maj7}hide    \\
^{D#} I don't have much ^{A#}money, but ^{G} boy, if I ^{Cm}did \\
^{D#} I'd buy a big h^{Fm7}ouse where ^{G#} we both could ^{A#}live ^{A#} \\

^{D#} If I was a s^{G#maj7}culptor (heh), ^{A#/D} but then again, ^{Gm} no   \\
Or a ^{Cm}man who makes ^{Cm/A#}potions in a ^{Cm/A} traveling sh^{G#maj7}ow, oh \\
I ^{D#}know it's not ^{A#}much but it's the ^{G}best I can ^{Cm}do  \\
^{D#} My gift is my ^{Fm7}song, and ^{G#} this one's for yo^{D#}u ^{D#}

^{A#/D} And you can tell ^{Cm}everybody ^{Fm7} this is your s^{G#maj7}ong    \\
^{A#/D} It may be ^{Cm}quite simple bu^{Fm}t now that it's d^{G#}one \\
^{Cm} I hope you don't mind,^{Cm/A#} I hope you don't mind
^{Cm/A}that I put down in w^{G#6}ords, ^{G#6} \\
How ^{D#/G}wonderful ^{Fm}life is while ^{G#}you're in the w^{A#}orld ^{A#}

^{D#} I sat on the ^{G#maj7}roof, ^{A#/D} and kicked off the ^{Gm}moss \\
Well a ^{Cm}few of the ^{Cm/A#}verses, well they've ^{Cm/A}got me quite cr^{G#maj7}oss    \\
^{D#} But the sun's been ^{A#}quite kind, ^{G} while I wrote this so^{Cm}ng \\
^{D#} It's for people like y^{Fm7}ou that ^{G#} keep it tu^{A#}rned on  ^{A#}  \\

^{D#} So excuse me forg^{G#maj7}etting, ^{A#/D} but these things ^{Gm}I do  \\
^{Cm} You see I've forg^{Cm/A#}otten if they're gr^{Cm/A}een or they're bl^{G#maj7}ue     \\
^{D#} Anyway, the thing is, ^{A#} what I really ^{G}mean     ^{Cm}   \\
^{D#} Yours are the swe^{Fm7}etest eyes ^{G#} I've ever seen  ^{D#} ^{D#}
