\begin{verse}
^{Gm7} She packed my bags last night - pre-^{C9}flight
^{Gm7} Zero hour, nine A.M. ^{C9} \\
^{D#} And I'm gonna be ^{A#}hi - ^{Cm}igh as a kite by ^{F}then \\
^{Gm7} I miss the earth so much, I ^{C9}miss my wife
^{Gm7} It's lonely out in ^{C9}space \\
^{D#} On such a ^{A#}ti - ^{Cm}imeless flight ^{F}
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{A#} And I think it's gonna be a long long ^{D#}time
til touchdown brings me 'round again to ^{A#}find \\ 
I'm not the man they think I am at ^{D#}home
Oh no, no, ^{A#}no, I'm a ^{C9}rocket man \\
^{D#}Rocket man, burnin' out his fuse up ^{A#}here alone ^{D#}

\begin{verse}
^{Gm7} Mars ain't the kinda place to ^{C9}raise your kids
^{Gm7} In fact it's cold as ^{C9}hell \\
^{D#} And there's no one ^{A#}there to ^{Cm}raise them if you ^{F}did \\
^{Gm7} And all this science, I don't under^{C9}stand
^{Gm7} It's just my job five days a ^{C9}week \\
A rocket ^{D#}ma - ^{A#}aa - ^{Cm}an, rocket ^{F}man
