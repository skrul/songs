\begin{verse}
I rem^{G}ember when rock was young,    me and ^{Bm}Susie had so much fun \\
Holding ^{C}hands and skimmin' stones  had a ^{D}old gold Chevy and a place of my own \\
But the ^{G}biggest kick I ever got    was doin' a ^{Bm}thing called the Crocodile Rock \\
While the ^{C}other kids were rockin' 'round the clock, we were ^{D}hoppin' and boppin' to the Crocodile Rock, well
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{Em} Crocodile Rockin' is something shockin' when your ^{A7}feet just can't keep still \\
^{D7} I never knew me a better time and I^{G} guess I never will. \\
^{E} Oh, Lawdy mamma those Friday nights when ^{A7}Susie wore her dresses tight and \\
^{D7} The Crocodile Rockin' was out of ^*{F}s ^*{-}i ^*{C}gh ^*{F}t ^*{-} ^{C} ^*{F} ^*{-} ^{C}

\begin{verse}
But the ^{G}years went by and rock just died, ^{Bm}Susie went and left me for some foreign guy \\
^{C}Long nights cryin' by the record machine, ^{D}dreamin' of my Chevy and my old blue jeans \\
But they'll ^{G}never kill the thrills we got,    burnin' ^{Bm}up to the Crocodile Rock \\
Learning ^{C}fast as the weeks went past, we really th^{D}ought the Crocodile Rock would last, well
