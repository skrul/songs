\begin{verse}
^{Dm7}I feel so un^{Gm7}sure \\
As I ^{Bbmaj7}take your hand and lead you ^{Am7}to the dance floor \\
^{Dm7} As the music dies ^{Gm7} Something in your eyes \\
^{Bbmaj7}Calls to mind a silver screen,
and ^{Am7}all its sad goodbyes
\end{verse} 

\begin{chorus}
^{Dm7} I'm never gonna dance again,
^{Gm7}guilty feet have got no rhythm \\
^{Bbmaj7} Though it's easy to pretend,
I ^{Am7}know you're not a fool \\
^{Dm7}Should've known better than to cheat a friend,
and ^{Gm7}waste the chance that I've been given \\
^{Bbmaj7} So, I'm never gonna dance again, the ^{Am7}way I danced with you - oo - oo
\end{chorus}

\begin{interlude}
^{Dm7}  ohh ^{Gm7}oh    ^{Bbmaj7}         ^{Am7}
\end{interlude} 
 
\begin{verse}
^{Dm7}Time can never ^{Gm7}mend \\
The ^{Bbmaj7}careless whispers ^{Am7}of a good friend \\
^{Dm7} To the heart and mind, ^{Gm7} ignorance is kind \\
^{Bbmaj7}There's no comfort in the truth, ^{Am7}pain is all you'll find
\end{verse}

\begin{bridge}
To^{Dm7}night, the music seems so loud, I ^{Gm7}wish that we could lose this crowd \\
^{Bbmaj7}Maybe it's better this way, we'd ^{Am7}hurt each other with the things we'd want to say \\
We ^{Dm7}could have been so good together, we ^{Gm7}could have lived this dance forever \\
But ^{Bbmaj7}now who's gonna dance with ^{Am7}me?   Please stay...

^{Dm7}      ^{Gm7}Oh ho           ^{Bbmaj7}          ^{Am7}    \\
^{Dm7} (Now that you're ^{Gm7}gone) Now that you're ^{Bbmaj7}gone       ^{Am7}    \\
^{Dm7} (Now that you're g^{Gm7}one) Was what I did so wrong?
So ^{Bbmaj7}wrong, that you had to ^{Am7}leave me alone? \\

^{Dm7} Do-waa ahh,  ^{Gm7} do-waa ahh, ^{Bbmaj7} do-waa ahh,  ^{Am7}  \\
^{Dm7} Do-waa ahh,  ^{Gm7} do-waa ahh, ^{Bbmaj7} do-waa ahh,  ^{Am7}  \\
