Some^{F#}body once ^{C#}told me the ^{G#m}world is gonna ^{B}roll me \\
I ^{F#}ain't the sharpest ^{C#}tool in the ^{G#m}shed  ^{B} \\
She was ^{F#}looking kinda ^{C#}dumb with her ^{G#m}finger and her ^{B}thumb \\

Well the ^{F#}years start coming and they ^{C#}don't stop coming, 
^{G#m}fed to the rules and I ^{B}hit the ground running \\
^{F#}Didn't make sense not to ^{C#}live for fun,
your ^{G#m}brain gets smart but your ^{B}head gets dumb \\
^{F#}So much to do ^{C#}so much to see,
so what's ^{G#m}wrong with taking the ^{B}back streets \\
You'll ^{F#}never know if you don't ^{C#}go,
you'll ^{G#m}never shine if you don't ^{B}glow

It's a ^{F#}cool place and they ^{C#}say it gets colder,
you're ^{G#m}bundled up now but wait '^{B}til you get older \\
But the ^{F#}meteor men beg to ^{C#}differ,
judging by the ^{G#m}hole in the satellite ^{B}picture \\
The ice we ^{F#}skate is getting pretty ^{C#}thin,
the waters getting ^{G#m}warm so you might as well ^{B}swim \\
My world's on ^{F#}fire how about ^{C#}yours,
that's the way I ^{G#m}like it and I never get ^{B}bored
