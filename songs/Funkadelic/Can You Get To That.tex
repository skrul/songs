\begin{verse}
I ^{E}once had a life, or rather, ^{A}life had me \\
I was ^{E}one among many or at ^{A}least I seemed to be \\
Well, I ^{E}read an old quotation in a ^{A}book just yesterday \\
Said "Gonna ^{E}reap just what you sow, \\
The debts you ^{A}make you have to pay." Can you get to that?
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{E}Can you get (I wanna know) \\
^{A}I want to know if you can get to that (hey! get to that!) \\
^{E}Can you get (can you get to that? I wanna know) \\
^{A}I want to know if you can get to that
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
I ^{E}recollect with a-^{A}mixed emotions \\
All the ^{E}good times we used to ^{A}have \\
But you were ^{E}making preparations \\
For the ^{A}coming separation \\
And you ^{E}blew everything we ^{A}had \\
When you ^{E}base your love on ^{A}credit \\
And your ^{E}loving days are ^{A}done \\
Checks you ^{E}signed with a-love and kisses \\
Later come back signed ^{A}"insufficient funds", Yeah, get to that
\end{verse}
 
\begin{chorus}
^{E}Can you get (I wanna know) \\
^{A}I want to know if you can get to that (hey! get to that!) \\
^{E}Can you get (can you get to that? I wanna know) \\
^{A}I want to know if you can get to that
\end{chorus}

When you ^{E}base your life on ^{A}credit \\
And your l^{E}oving days are ^{A}done \\
