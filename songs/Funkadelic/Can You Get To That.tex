\begin{verse}
I ^{E}once had a life, or rather, ^{A} life had me \\
I was ^{E}one among many, or at ^{A}least I seemed to be \\
Well, I ^{E}read an old quotation in a ^{A}book just yesterday \\
Said "Gonna ^{E}reap just what you sow, the debts you ^{A}make you have to pay." Can you get to that?
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{E} Can you get (I wanna know) ^{A} I want to know if you can get to that (hey! get to that!) \\
^{E} Can you get (I wanna know) ^{A} I want to know if you can get to that
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
I ^{E}recollect with a-^*{D}mix ^{-}ed ^{A}emotions all the ^{E}good times we used to have ^{D} ^{-} ^{A} \\
But you were ^{E}making preparations for the ^*{D}com ^{-}ing ^{A}separation and you ^{E}blew everything we had ^{D} ^{-} ^{A} \\
\\ 
When you ^{E}base your love on credit and your ^{E}loving days are done \\
Checks you ^{E}signed with a-love and kisses later come back signed ^{E}"insufficient funds", Yeah, get to that
