\begin{verse}
I ^{A}got some free advice just the other ^{A}day from an older relative of ^{D}mine ^{D} \\
^{E} He said, "You know, I dig what you do, ^{E} but I think you're wasting your ^{A}time, yes I do ^{A} \\
\mbox{Because ^{A}drivin' around and gettin' ^{A}drunk with your friends in a van every night, ^{D}yea that sounds like a lotta ^{D}fun \space } \\
But you need a plan ^{E}B, 'cause it ain't gonna ^{E}last long past twenty ^{E}one" ^{E}

\begin{verse}
^{A} Bummed a cigarette from a guy ^{A}when I was in Manhattan last week, ^{D} and I told him politely, "thank ya" ^{D} \\
Then with this ho^{E}llowed out look, he turned and said "you ^{E}know, for twenty five years ^{A}I've been a banker ^{A} \\
And ya know, ^{A}in all my many years of ^{A}life, I suddenly feel ^{D}obliged to impart to you this ^{D}free piece of advice \\
