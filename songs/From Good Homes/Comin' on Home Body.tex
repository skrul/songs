^{G#} Tommy Conroy, friend of mine said,
^{G#} "I ain't a dog and I ain't gonna take it!" \\

to California, ^{G#} up the Al-Can into Alaska \\
^{C#}Spotted a piece of land on the coast,
said "I'm ^{C#}gonna make a livin' workin on a fishin' boat" \\
^{G#}Six months later the boat went bye,
left him ^{G#}sittin' on the beach high and dry \\
He headed ^{C#}back out on the highway,
comin' home, his ^{C#}pockets all empty and his tail between his legs!
